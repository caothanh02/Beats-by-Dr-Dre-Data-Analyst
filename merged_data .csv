R2SSSH04J4J264,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice portable speaker for the price. Solid buy!,Bruce C,5,"Needed a new portable speaker for the home setup and once I saw that Beats (read: Apple) came out with the new Beats Pill, I bit the bullet and purchased one.First things first, the unboxing experience and the design of the speaker is quintessentially Apple. Speaker has a nice heft to it and the design of the speaker is really nice, with the angled design, and the speakers facing you.If you are in the Apple Ecosystem, this speaker was made for you as it connects to your iPhone the minute you turn it on with a very satisfying screen animation. I'm told you can easily connect with an Android product too but I didn't have one in hand to test out how easy it was.The sound quality of this speaker is really great for its size, living up to the Beats name, filling the room with punchy bass and crystal clear sound. Rated IP67 meaning it is dust and water resistant, so you can feel confident taking it to your next beach party or when you are traveling. Battery life of this thing is stated at a whopping 24 hrs. I'll definitely be testing that claim, but if true, is completely mind blowing.But what sets this speaker apart, and one of the main reasons why I bought it, is that it also doubles as a speakerphone!!! I can connect this badboy to my laptop, and take crystal clear Teams calls with it all day at work. And when I'm done with my calls, since it is connected to my laptop via USB-C, I can listen to lossless music on Apple Music. Mind...blown!Run, don't walk, to buy this awesome speaker!!","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFVM53KRAU5JC462ZZDBBKTESPGA,True,18,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R4BQHA0TLLJNN,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Speaker I have ever bought in my life!,Leox,5,"I really like the new Beats Pill 2024 speaker. The sound quality is amazing with great bass and clear vocals. It's small, stylish, and easy to carry around, which is perfect for when I'm on the go.The battery lasts a long time, even with heavy use, and connecting it to my devices with Bluetooth is super easy. The design looks good and fits well with any room or setup.The only downside is that there isn't an app to control the speaker. It would be nice to have an app to adjust settings, check battery life, and manage connections. Even without this, the Beats Pill 2024 is a fantastic speaker that I highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AEUCX7EIPTMCFN4OJBZHL2OYSVKQ,True,8,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R39X7USU3OX34C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good,Justin,5,"So I’m super picky about sound and have spent a decent amount of money over the years finding good speakers. I was currently using the B&O Bluetooth speaker which is really good and is a bit more money than this. Prior I had Bose and some of other brands. Compared to all of them this is an amazing speaker for the price point. Bass is great. Clarity is great. Build quality is great. You can even hook it up via usb c to get lossless music. I didnt notice much a difference that way. Also if your in the apple eco system it works like AirPods where you can switch between devices and also locate the speaker via find my. Note I have also tried both of the newest beats over ear headphones and hated them, so I was surprised that this was as good as it is.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AFSZPNTTLYCLNP536L6VS6UMFTNQ,True,7,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2EVRTXO9M1YF7,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Is it the JBL killer?,Tommy,4,"I bought this because it was on sale, and I always wanted a beats pill.I am a JBL user, and firmly stand by their quality and sound.Does this compete with Flip 6? Absolutely.Does it compete with Charge 4 or 5? Definitely not.Heres whySound: i purchased the Black Pill, right out of the box it is versatile in the sense it matches anything you have. I could’ve went with Champagne as well and would’ve also fit. I compared to flip 6 right away, it is Brighter, crisper and deeper bass at 50% volume and lower.However at above 50% the bass becomes muddy, it has this weird flutter sound to it. The Flip 6 Still Sounds great at 50% and lower just it sounds a little quieter and less vibrant compared to the Pill.The Charge 4 and 5 are bigger speakers and has bigger woofers.The pill is definitely very portable, great performance and most definitely great value for the money.Maybe later down the road i will purchase another for stereo sound bars for our TV.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AHAMVBSECCNUJMQV6A3BO3A3HNMA,True,5,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

RTDXQGCW5S0SA,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Scooley,4,"I bought the new pill mainly to use wired for my gaming handhelds ROG Ally X and Steam Deck. Most Bluetooth speakers today are lacking AUX ports and any type of direct connection. Bluetooth audio is delayed which is annoying when playing a game or watching a video.CON: Only 4 stars instead of 5 because to use this wired you need to hold down the power button when you plug in the USB-C cable, so essentially, I have to do this every day. It's annoying and almost was almost a deal breaker. I've just gotten used to unplugging it when I take my handheld off the dock, it's nice that it powers off immediately when unplugged, so there's that, I guess.PRO: The new Beats Pill sounds good, it's better than a lot of other Bluetooth speakers I've had. Being in the Apple ecosystem it's nice that it's interconnected with my devices. One not so well-known feature is that you can change the volume of the tones the speaker makes when it turns on or off. Use an IOS device, go into settings in Bluetooth and Accessibility. Having a low volume tone is soo much better!","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,True,3,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R10YJBZGOB4SBS,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars No App for IOS. No way to disable loud startup/poweroff tones,Kindle in Hawaii,4,"Love these speakers, but Apple seemed to have made a bit screw up.The speaker makes a very loud startup and power down sound. NO way to turn them off.Also, Apple does NOT have an IOS version of Beats that will support the Beats Pill 2024. Instead, only supports the old Beats Pill+.Totally confusing! Big oversight by Apple. Hope they will get around someday to updating or creating a new app or just add this functionality inside the existing IOS to support disabling of these tones.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2024",AEF7JE6TACESBPXTYHKCLUEIJVFA,True,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

The tone when pairing emits a very low end bass note that gets you excited for the performance expected from Beats... However, with this being said, the performance is only half of what I hoped... the programmed sound processing limits using an external eq as boosted bass significantly drops the volume at each note, which is sad because pill doesn't have an eq in its app at all.... the sound you get between 40 percent and lower is where this shines, mids are clear and neutral, highs are clear and crisp without any harshness, and there is a slight amount of low end at lower volume, but past halfway volume and the bass distorts and the programming takes over to then roll off the bass and then it's mostly just mids and highs.... They seriously could've added a passive radiator to the back of this thing and then would have something here....

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

The sound from this small speaker is impressive. The bass is rich, and the mids and highs are clear, delivering a full, immersive audio experience. With up to 24 hours of battery life, this speaker lasts through even the longest days. The speaker connects seamlessly with both Apple and Android devices. Pairing is quick and easy, and the connection remains stable without any drops. There is a built-in microphone that is a handy feature for taking calls or using voice commands.

It has a detachable lanyard that makes it easy to carry, and a silicone backing for an easy grip. Despite the small size, it delivers powerful sound with good bass and clear highs. I mostly use this out by the pool, so I like the IP67 water rating. It’s been heavily splashed several times, with no ill effects. The battery life is excellent, and easily lasts me through a couple of days of listening. It comes with a USB-C TO USB-C charging cable.I love that this doubles as a speakerphone. I can connect it to my laptop for work calls, and the sound quality is excellent. Beats is a quintessentially Apple product, but don’t let that scare you off if you’re an Android fan like myself.

RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn’t get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I’ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven’t tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button’s commands—while certainly vast—are greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It’s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I’m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I’ve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it’s been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony’s music center app, and while it’s a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker’s functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money’s worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it’s a great edition to anyone’s outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I’m certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AHWLZPJ4HLRGSDCGXHCEWVVOGX4Q,True,25,Color: Off White

R3MI1MH02YEDHK,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew before I bought this.,Pat,5,"The media could not be loaded. So, yes 5 stars, and I mean that. To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker. Hope this review helps!!!","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGCVXRAC7KRNWUCTJSFA2D44CDNA,True,66,Color: Forest Gray
RJFBE7W2A9HWL,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try! You won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AGCP3WP3ZNQM7W7TXE7ADU62LOXQ,True,15,Color: Black

R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,True,7,Color: Off White
R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AE4ZT3YRO52IIPX2LKOJLEM3STMQ,True,4,Color: Orange

My issue is that it only turns up a little with my phone and tablet. If I'm listening to a talk and the person has a quiet voice, I can't hear clearly. Even with the device turned all the way up and the speaker itself turned all the way up. Music sounds great from this speaker. I do like the cord the speaker has on top so it can be hung. I don't think it was worth the price I paid for it. Maybe $50, but $99 I would expect better. So far the battery life has been excellent and it was easy to set up the Bluetooth.

R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,True,3,Color: Forest Gray

I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose’s bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It’s a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I’d recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won’t be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it’s no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AETUKYROFNVEVSRJY2ABCK6XYUSA,True,4,Color: Orange

R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXL5KTBD,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is—making it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5’s, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony’s engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it’s unleashing the Iron Giant, and I’m here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my “connected devices” widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12” Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1.

There are so many Sony speakers and different price points. This speaker sounded like you had a subwoofer and connected speakers at a party that’s how the quality was in this mini speaker. It’s water proof the strap was better than expected I didn’t care for it but now I can attach to my surroundings environment it’s like an extra nice touch. The app you download is not needed to play or connect it’s just nice if u have multiple speakers to connect gives you battery info etc. the charging is usb C and it fast charging. I just got this speaker and I’m writing a review this shows how excited and amazed I am still ha. The Price for the speaker well it’s definitely worth it. 1 u can buy two for under 300 vers 1 speaker for that price and have surround sound.

My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard. I'd like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother's Day and Graduation around the corner.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AFKMNV7MVRWKIXFNFEJOIYWBOUSA,True,17,Color: Off White

Sony ULT 1 is awesome and I'll explain why.Bass is still extremely strong but does not drown out the highs and for the first time I hear a mid range. The sound is just so much better compared to JBL. JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound. Now I realize it's just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something. If you want great sound quality Sony does it best. The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it's super easy to connect with my iPhone. Most of all no light show pretty straight forward which I like when I go camping and the beach. I'm definitely going to get the bigger version ULT7 for the pool but wanted to test this one first.

Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It’s fine if that’s all you want, but the equalization isn’t there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It’s pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn’t fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I’m glad I picked this one. It’s definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs.

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that’s very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I’m sure it’s not perfect, but it’s more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I’ve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no “filling up” in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you’re still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,True,254,Color: Black

R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a “party” speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it’s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there’s even some punch of the bass. It’s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. 😂So (for now), I’m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don’t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It’s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn’t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to…2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it’s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They’re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you’ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The “Used” unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone’s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled “Refurbished”. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn’t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I’d like y’all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you’re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn’t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don’t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,120,Color: Black

I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It’s loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn’t exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you’ll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I’m used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn’t really have any equalizer setting on there if that’s what you’re loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it’s almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I’m going to keep this speaker with me. Now let’s see if the battery life is legit.

R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my décor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,True,26,Color: Chilled Lilac

Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,True,2,Color: Black

I tried to return the item on Amazon, then saw a troubleshooting video. Open your 'systems settings' on your computer and select 'sound'; click the Bose option for speaker 'output'. For some reason this Bose unit doesn't default as the output as other Bluetooth speakers did on my computer. Then you should be able to hear it.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AGMDFCAFNSOMPAQOPYPJSNKY2HGA,True,1,Color: Stone Blue

It has a “party” setting also. I have a wraparound porch so it stretches the sound out nicely! I like the rubber cover because I use them outside a lot! It was easy to pair it to my phone and to pair up the second speaker. Just follow the instructions provided! This was a great investment because I’m all about music 🎶 and good sound. I even listen to my podcasts using them. You can adjust the speakers either by the controls on the speaker or by your phone, which is really convenient! Even if I’m talking on the phone and want the conversation heard, it can come across the speaker! The USB/C charger cord comes with it. It charges very quickly! I like when you turn it on it tells you what the battery level is at and where it is paired to. These are the best little speakers with a huge sound that I have ever had! But then….it’s a BOSE!!!! The loop on the side makes it possible to hang the speaker easily too. That’s especially helpful outside on the porch where I have a number of hooks for hanging plants! I don’t have to worry about its stability, although it has a nice balance of weight to it just to sit it on a railing! If you like what I described, you will want to own one or more!

It was always saying the speaker disconnected even though it was still playing. The app let me turn off the voice prompts. Then I found the actual user manual online and discovered an alternate method:Press and hold + and - simultaneously until you hear “Voice prompts off.”It sounds pretty good, but I mosty use it for voice.It doesn't matter how it is oriented; it still sounds good.But the material that it's made of is messy.

I just got this one and the sound is even better!!

It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected. It's the little details that are missing that list a star. Would I buy again?

I don’t consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously — 100k+ hours annually — and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It’s not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it’s waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money — many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it’s worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It’s worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose “RETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.” I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

R1L69GMOAWA48D,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars No Competition,Nicholas,5,"JBL Flip 6 Bluetooth speaker. I’ve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now, but finding the time to do so has been difficult. As I mentioned before in a previous post, JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are excellent. As someone who prefers a HiFi setup (individual components like a receiver, CD player, turntable, bookshelf speakers, etc.), I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers. I prefer the definition, clarify, and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver, and that preference has not changed. But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits. I’ve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years, mainly Ultimate Ears speakers, and I couldn’t believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers. I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6. For such a small speaker, I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was. I’ve since tried out the JBL Charge 5, the JBL Xtreme 3, and even the JBL Boombox 3, and each one of those speakers produces great sound. The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous, and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you’re entertaining guests in a small or medium-sized venue. At the end of the day, I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home, and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high-quality amplifier or receiver, but JBL’s Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you. Again, I recommend the Flip 6, but if you’re able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3.I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy. You know I can’t help myself. By the way, both of those books in the photo are superb.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGZQIVFUCTPC4TGGHIGE3RURP6AA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

RILMKXRAW75NM,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds excellent outdoors,Austin Yde,5,"This speaker has definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of audio quality. It does a have a few imperfections, but overall I think it deserves 5 stars. The mids and highs get drowned out a bit by the bass when indoors. However, I’ve found that when outside, the OP bass overcompensates for the fact that bass does not carry as well in open space and this speaker sounds spot on. It gets pretty loud, but I did expect it to have a bit more, but the speaker is much smaller than I expected. That might just be me. This feels very well constructed and is fairly heavy. Highly recommend for audiophiles looking for an outdoor speaker that you want to bring with you anywhere.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AF3PVTN5RKAL3R2VZTNN6W5N3BIQ,True,0,Color: GreyStyle: Flip 6

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you’ll have killer stereo mode. And the charge 5 to the center and you will love the sound as it acts like a sub reinforcement.,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

These speakers provide an immersive audio experience, allowing you to truly feel the music and get lost in its rhythm. Whether you're enjoying your tunes or cranking up the volume for a dance party, this speaker is guaranteed to impress. The bass is deep and punchy, adding that extra kick to your music.One aspect that really stood out to me is its portability. Despite its powerful sound output, this speaker is surprisingly compact and lightweight. You can effortlessly carry it with you wherever you go, be it a picnic or a fun beach gathering. Moreover, with its IP67 rating, it's designed to withstand dust and water, making it ideal for all kinds of escapades.Connecting to this speaker couldn't be easier thanks to its Bluetooth functionality. Pairing it with my phone was a breeze, and I experienced no issues with the connection throughout my usage. Furthermore, the speaker offers a range that grants me freedom of movement without any concerns about losing connectivity.Battery life is always a concern when using speakers; however, the Sony SRS-XG300 has got you covered in that department. With a 24-hour battery life, you can enjoy music all day and night without needing to worry about recharging. It even comes with a USB port, allowing you to conveniently charge your devices while on the move.Finally, the design is sleek and contemporary. It's evident that Sony has meticulously considered every aspect, from the construction to the user controls. The LED lights bring an element that enhances the atmosphere and perfectly complements the music.If you're looking for a great speaker for a little more price this is the one. Its the perfect speaker to use everyday whether its inside or out.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2023",AEIKMFWY3SV4YRDCG2KL6OTUP4TQ,True,30,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

It's a little big, and kinda heavy, but the built in handle makes transport a breeze - and it lays flat when not in use. The speaker is very well designed, and looks great. It gets fairly loud, but nothing too crazy. The JBLs definitely get louder, but I like the sound quality of the Sony better. At low to mid volumes, you can get over 12 hours of constant playing from the speaker. At near full volume, it's more like 6-8. If you like how it looks, and are in the market for this style speaker, give it a shot.

This boombox has great features, including TWO USB-A ports so you can use one to play music from a USB stick, and another to charge your phone, plus a mic/guitar input!

First make sure the LDAC is engaged and I also found the live setting to get more clarity and sparkle than the megebass setting and last but not least use a third party music app (I recommend Musicolet) it has multiple EQ band settings and also preamp to boost the volume of your music.With these 3 factors addressed this speaker produces some of the most well-balanced sound of all my Bluetooth speakers especially for its size, just like a fine instrument, it has to be tuned to get the best sound quality from it!!","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AEBN67HUWEPFLVQN4KCYKDGAWVRQ,True,7,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

In other words, it changed devices on me without any prompting, and this cannot be controlled.There isn't a way to remove devices that are connected to the speaker, and the app that ""controls"" the speaker is equally unhelpful.

(Bow Hunting Skills, Numchuck skills, you know the rest....)",Natascha,5,"+The sound is amazing,+the battery life seems to last forever (especially if you turn off lights and bass boost, but even leaving them on...I'm still so impressed)+It looks super nice. I use this primarily as a home speaker actually that I move around at times, and I think it's a great speaker serving that role, too. I find it impressive truly as an ALL IN ONE product, you know? I must say, even after reviews, this speaker is better experienced in person than the reviews can even show. It's truly impressive. I think when asking if you should buy this or not, the answer is definitely YES if you want the extra features. For example,++ being able to turn this into a guitar amp is gonna make me feel especially cool when I very poorly sing and play guitar. I don't know how often I'll use this, but to have that as an option as actually pretty freaking sweet.++ Being able to charge things from my speaker, even if pretty slowly, is cool and useful.++ Being able to plug in an amazon echo into this speaker and have Alexa voice activated assistance is also freaking sweet. Having such a long battery life is a convenience even just using this mostly as a home speaker.This speaker really does rock! ;) It has numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, it just has skillz. It's NOICE!(I hope this review helps someone in some way. Remember to embrace your inner Napoleon.)which one, you say?You decide!Do you want this even at all AND you have the money? If so, go for it! If you want to spend less and don't mind lacking a few features, (features lik a guitar amp plug, an aux plug, two usb a charging ports, and a super long battery life), consider other options like the Soundcore Motion Boom Plus. You can spend half the price and get something that sounds really, really good still if just having something that plays good sounding music is your primary concern. It will lack some features, but they may be things you wouldn't really prioritize or use often anyway on a more feautre ridden speaker. Being poor, sometimes spending more really pays off, but it doesn't always. Sometimes I'm just as satisfied with a product at a lower price that still has 98% of the other features in common with higher priced items. Does paying more pay off here? Well, I think for the most part yes. I think the features really are fun.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2023",AECHBLEF5TE4MITCQKBMC4TNVGWQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG500

R1WXFJO25KJ87Y,B0B43Y8GHZ,2.0 out of 5 stars Worse sound than expected,Strikeout321,2,"We have a large family that likes to listen to music. In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc…and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it’s older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there’s virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of “tinny” during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn’t sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that’s half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that’s about the most I would ever pay for it…but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you’ll be disappointed once you use it. Go with a JBL Extreme or UE MegaBoom (if you want that larger size speaker), you will be much happier with your purchase. The JBL Boombox is my favorite Bluetooth speaker by far, but it’s stupid expensive and way overkill for most people.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2024",AGNGXFTNXGOGLV6JO4MVPOM5CUUQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues. I do love Sony products but I'm also glad I got this on a promotional sale ($100 off) because I likely wouldn't have paid the normal price. I also love that it has USB-C charging, as well an extra USB port to charge my phone.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2023",AFWNZK4LRKC6XEYUANWC7Z3MLDWA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

Here are the reasons why this was the right decision even though this speaker cost a little more.1. Battery life. I use this speaker 4 times a week for at least 5 hours and I only charge it once a month.2. Waterproof. I take this speaker on a small sailboat during regatta racing. It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn’t specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product. The grip is too flimsy for the weight of the speaker. Better you get that carry strap that can snap on.,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AEGU5Q7IAD6FC2LGLCE4D2GZBBTQ,True,9,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

The sound profiles help to adjust as needed. My expectations on these were pretty low given they are small battery powered speakers but I am impressed with what it produces.

It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE I WAS SOLD A ""RETURNED/REFURBISHED"" speaker.

At least as good as Sonos PLAY:3, and almost as good as PLAY:5 (a heavy non-portable speaker).2) It comes with me to the hot tub.3) Bluetooth! Don't need Wifi.4) I get to just use the Apple Music app and don't have to mess with Sonos app (neither are wonderful, but Sonos was more confusing).I seriously can't believe this product is 6 years old.

You can take it off the cradle while playing music and move to another room without a beep or pause or interruption. It pauses while you answer your phone and picks right back up when your done.

So silly me, I thought sound technology has come a long way in 15 years so I better get a new BT speaker hoping to upgrade the sound. Well after trying the JBL Charge 5 and then later the Marshall Emberton II, I am sticking with my old Bose.This is the environment that I tested all three speakers...I use my speaker outside on the patio. Never louder than 30-40% volume as the houses are pretty close. (normal subdivision) .A / B tests...I had two other people give me their opinions (blind speaker tests) All of us picked my old Bose Sound Link Mini as sounding better then both the Charge 5 and Marshall E II.My music background is strictly non technical, but I do know good sounding music and good mid to high end theater sound. This is my option using them in the environment that I listed above. The old Bose just sounded more open especially at lower volumes. ( I think they call it ""sound stage"") You may be saying BS but I didn't expect the winner to be the Bose either. but, three different ears picked the Bose. The Marshall always came in ahead of the JBL C 5 in sound, design and looks. So if you need IP67 or longer battery life than go with the Marshall II. But again I think the Bose had slightly better overall sound to me.Take this info with a grain of salt but after hours of testing this was my conclusion.I have also read the the newer Bose speakers like the Sound link mini II or special edition are not as good as the older one that I have... ??? But I have not heard them.I hope it helps.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024",AGSKI2RNYNCQJJPOUCFDJFWQJ55Q,False,0,Color: Silver

R2NMM68S0SFMXE,B01LZRFI5C,5.0 out of 5 stars You will not regret this purchase!,The Best Yak Ever,5,"Okay, I love this little speaker. I had a cheapo DOSS speaker that was roughly the same size for my bathroom. I wanted my bathroom to have a Bluetooth enabled sound system to connect to an old iPad Air 2 that I have mounted on an articulating wall mount. I thought it’d be a perfect use for my old iPad but found that the DOSS system couldn’t get loud enough to hear over the running shower. I have always loved Bose products and decided to try out this system. It was inexpensive and produces phenomenal sound for such a small package. Not only can I listen to music without needing it to be cranked to max volume, but podcasts and YouTube videos come through loud and clear with the shower running full bore. I would have settled for a power cord reliant speaker, but this thing has a battery with great battery life. I have moved it to the kitchen while I cleaned, my soap workshop, and my garage shop. It’s ultra portable and amazing. Buy one of these pups, and don’t waste your money and time with cheaper systems. You’ll get what you pay for and won’t regret it. I ended up being so impressed that I also ordered a Bose Soundtouch 20 for my kitchen and a 30 for my living room. I guess almost every room in my house has an awesome sound system in it (media room has a Lifestyle 650 and bedroom has an older Lifestyle T20). The result, a house with incredible sound and music capacity.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2019",AHREB66RSQMVGV6VRSCDY53OQPYQ,True,4,Color: Black

R2L8S9XZDR4ZS1,B01LZRFI5C,4.0 out of 5 stars The LAST Soundlink Mini!,M. H. Brandon,4,"Back in the day, I was an early adopter of the original Soundlink Mini. I enjoyed it but Bose had severe battery problems. It was out of warranty and wouldn't keep a charge. Then the Soundlink Mini II came out and I loved it. Better sound, speakerphone capability and that awful battery problem that Bose STILL didn't fix. I actually hadn't used it all that much and knowing the properties of lithium-ion batteries, couldn't believe it wouldn't hold a charge.I had the same problems with my Bose Soundsport Free true wireless earphones. The case wouldn't hold a charge!So I needed a good Bluetooth speaker. I found that Bose was still manufacturing the Limited Edition Soundlink Mini. I ran across a YouTube video comparing the Mini to the new Bose Revolve speaker. The author of the video used binaural microphones to record the sound signature to the viewer. To cut to the chase, the Mini sounded BETTER than the new Revolve! I won't get into the sound characteristics but to my ears, I enjoyed the MINI sound much more.The dilemma.... do I buy the Mini, Revolve or look elsewhere? I needed a speaker that was rich sounding, had speakerphone capability and was small enough for my needs. Taking a big chance, as I'm sure BOSE never fixed the battery issue, I bought the MINI. When I unboxed it and starting charging it, the battery was totally dead as I could tell by the length of time it took to charge it. It's early, but everything is working well but I haven't drained the battery yet.BOSE...being a prodigious company that enjoys over the top profits like Apple, probably had a bunch of these things in a warehouse or shipped to retailers that sat and collected dust. The point is: if you like this product like I do, then buy one as they're not going to last long. Buy a warranty but if it malfunctions, don't be surprised if BOSE can't/won't repair it. In that case, they won't have a replacement for you and you'll have to be satisfied with a refund.To wrap this up, enjoy the sound like I do and good luck if the battery issue rears its ugly head.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2019",AFHXOMH66D4SOI74VEUQMXQNH5RQ,True,8,Color: Black

I first heard this when someone brought one to a presentation. I have the Bose Soundlink Color II, which I liked very much. But it struck me immediately that this Soundlink Mini II Limited sounded significantly better. The bass response alone was a revelation. I had to get one before they disappeared.This is a very small speaker, smaller than the Color II (though this weighs a bit more). But its sound is truly exceptional, as so many have stated. You have to experience that much sound coming from this tiny thing to really appreciate it. Disregard reviews that criticize its sound. I have no idea what they're talking about. This thing sounds great in every way. It gets quite loud depending on your Bluetooth source. Highs are crisp and defined with a darn good mid range. But that bass! How do they do that? It's such a kick!Don't know what the battery and Bluetooth issues are that some have complained about. I've no problems with those at all so far. Holds a charge for at least six hours, as far as I can tell. Pairs immediately. No dropouts. Smooth sailing all the way.For a speaker you could throw in the smallest bag, this thing rocks.

I will give you the Pros & the Cons.I've had this Bose Soundlink Mini II Speaker for about 2 months now.Pros:The Sound Quality is FANTASTIC. It's truly amazing. This speaker gives incredible bass and high quality sound. I love the portability of it. I don't have any problems pairing this with my computer and my phone. Truly a great speaker in terms of sound quality.Cons:I discovered a month after I received it that it stopped charging. For a few days, it was completely unable to charge while either being directly plugged in or sitting on the charging port. Nothing worked for several days and the battery % kept dropping. Then I went through page after page of old reviews on this product and other Bose Bluetooth speakers. And then I discovered that this is a common problem on ALL Bose Bluetooth speakers. And then I started researching other bluetooth speakers by other companies, such as Sony and JBL. Turns out ALL bluetooth speakers have issues with them losing the ability to charge the battery. It's an industry problem among bluetooth speakers. Disheartened, due to the prevalence of the problem among all bluetooth speakers, I decided to keep the speaker because there appeared to be no better option available.Fortunately, the speaker started charging again and I haven't had any problems the last few weeks. I'm cautiously optimistic. But I'm also nervous, because if you go through Bose Soundlink Mini II reviews, you will see MANY people complaining of the same problem that seems to get worse as the months go by.Again, the sound quality is FANTASTIC. It's just a matter of finding out if these speakers have any longevity. That's my major concern. Perhaps in 10 months I can update this review to reflect how it's lasted.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2018",AFTIYYWYUM532OMA5CA36SFYTN6Q,True,902,Color: Black

Lane,4,"I have many Bose products and still enjoy them all, including my original SoundLink Mini, but after 8 years the battery life has decreased significantly, as anything with a battery in it will eventually. I went to Amazon to get the newer model, the SL Mini II. The one I bought was advertised as ""Limited Edition."" According to Bose, this designation does not exist, and nowhere on the box or the unit does it say Limited Edition. Bose currently sells a ""Special Edition,"" and what I received is not the SE, either. This ""LE"" unit has the copper-colored logo on the front, same as the regular SL-M2. I did much research on this, including two calls to Bose, so it is not lightly that I say the ""Limited Edition"" in the product name is misleading.After fully charged, I used my new SL-M2 for a few days. It worked great, even speakerphone mode (a new feature for the M2), but I noticed that as soon as the charging cord was pulled, it said battery was at 90% and dropping. It did not charge. I believe the unit I was sold sat on the shelf for an extended period of time, and thus affected battery life. Amazon took great steps to quickly get me a replacement unit. I'm happy for great customer service, but disappointed to get a bum speaker as brand new.UPDATE: The replacement speaker arrived, and has worked great for 2 weeks, charging as it should. I must have got a unit with a bad battery (VERY common issue, I gather), so I upped my rating, because it is an excellent product.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2020",AHJU44MYTANGJJ6KPVIR3ENGQJRQ,True,4,Color: Black

After about 1 hour of trying to hear what was being played, at full volume, I swapped back over to the old Lax-Max speaker...which I have to turn the volume down with. (No, the sound quality is not quite the same...hence the attempt at the Bose purchase). Brought the Bose back home, set back in the kitchen, and when powered up, the cute little voice tells me I have 3 hours of battery life left? But wait, I only used you for an hour?Bottom line: if you don't intend to use this in a room, in your house, or in a non-background noise area...I would pass on this one.

Not a rich man but doing well the price was from my “treat “ fund. I first heard Bose speakers at a friends home in the early 70s, looking around trying to figure out where his tunes were coming from when he pointed to two stands with small boxes on them. They were no bigger as I recal then a small cereal box that you cut open and use as a bowl. I think he had a bass or woofer on the floor but the point being it was a tremendous sound!Jump to February of this year and I purchased this amazing speaker! I have several small blue tooth speakers in the 30 dollar range, but we are comparing watermelons to cherries here.The video is from a very inexpensive michrophone, 30 dollar range which you will see.But look at the spectrum analysis of what the mike is inputting to.Each division represents 250 Hertz (cycles per second for some of us elderly gentlemen! Lol)So at the left end you see zero to 250 Hertz in the first “square” the next division to the right is 250 to 500 Hertz. Middle C on a piano is around the “A” 440 Hertz so its in this or the next “square”. The “square” or division (sorry for going back and forth between division and square!) at the far right shows the frequencies between 2,250 Hertz and 2,500 Hertz in the over tones. Hope this makes sense. This is a visual representation of the music broken down showing the frequencies coming out of the Bose speaker through a very inexpensive microphone. If you play the video you will hear it as wellYes I will recommend this speaker to my friends!","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2018",AGY6NAN6YPAW73K3P3J7QDSZAB7A,True,194,Color: Black

The Tannoy Live Mini is better in every way.",Babis,3,"I have been trying to find a good sounding portable speaker for the past 2 years. Tried dozens of speakers. The Bose Soundlink mini II has a pleasant sound signature that gives it a sense of clarity. Amar Bose was a professor at MIT and an expert in psychoacoustics. If you watch his lectures online, you will see that he knows how to change frequencies to give you an illusion that the sound comes from elsewhere, or is being reflected, to create the perception of a live performance. However, this coloration causes a lot of distortion in some genres. Piano sounds like a detuned, distorted mess. While the boosted treble gives a perception of clarity and detail, it can also make the speaker sound cheap, and heavily distorts focals. Female vocals can sound harsh and sibilant. Just watch How to get away with murder on Netflix and you will hear horrible distortion and hissing on S's and T's. This makes the speaker sound like a cheap radio.If you have an Samsung Android phone or tablet, there is a useful EQ under 'sound quality and effects'. These EQ settings can reduce the sibilance and distortion.63Hz +2dB125Hz -2 dB250Hz 0dB500Hz 0dB1kHz 0dB2kHz 0dB4kHz -2dB8kHz -4dB16kHz +4dBBose should have equalized this speaker better in the factory, or with a firmware updateTwo years and 20 speakers later (Bose S6 PA, Bose Portable Home Speaker, Denon Envaya BT250, Marshall Killburn II, Stockwell II, Emberton, B&O Beolit, etc), I discovered the Tannoy Live Mini and was shocked by its performance. It sounds like a studio monitor and wipes the floor with the Bose. Punchy base, clear treble and pure vocals. It also supports AptX, unlike the Bose and the Marshall Emberton.I recommend trying both the Bose Soundlink Mini II and Tannoy Live Mini and hear the difference in sound quality yourself.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2020",AGGL4OUJI2IS5XNHVAXJB3AIECNA,True,3,Color: Black

R28ZD7KMUIXXQK,B01LZRFI5C,"3.0 out of 5 stars Please, Bose, give us a REMOTE CONTROL",Christine Raymond,3,"Update:1. I have discovered finally that, when paired to my Echo Dot, I can verbally control the volume by telling Alexa “volume 1” to “volume 10” or “volume up”. This wasn’t working initially, so I’m happy to finally have it controllable in this way. I would still like to have a REMOTE CONTROL.2. Battery life while not being used is really lousy. Charge it, listen for 20 minutes, come back in a day or so, battery dead. Trying to solve this without keeping it plugged in all the time.Original review: My feeling on this speaker is....eh.It’s small and the sound is great. Those are the good things.The not-so-good things:1. You can only control the volume by walking over to the speaker & pressing the up or down buttons. You can not buy a remote for it; I tried. You can not control volume through the Bose app. You literally have to press the buttons. And they’re squishy buttons that aren’t very sensitive. So, when you tell Alexa to play some Amos Lee early in the morning while you get ready for work & it comes blaring out because your husband was listening to something the day before at top volume, and you can’t get the squishy volume down button to respond quickly, it’s not pleasant.2. The battery dies quickly when not in use even when the power is off. I’m considering leaving it on the charger all the time but that’s disappointing to have to do.3. There’s no way to know the volume setting without playing a song. There’s no range of 0 to 10 on a readout. So if you were blasting it yesterday, it’s going to come blasting out today. But you won’t know to expect it because there’s no readout.There’s probably no better sounding portable/rechargeable speaker, but it has its drawbacks.","Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2019",AHASFQZZGIK4YMYPEUE2WKWAXMFQ,True,3,Color: Black

Android+Precise Volume on Google Play = BLISS,ToxicWaste,5,"Im not stranger to Bose products, as I'm still rocking a Cinema Series from 2001. I didn't want to spend the $ on another BT speaker, as amazingly, the high wattage Anker brand speaker works excellent (quality is degrading almost 2 years later). I saw this one and it had a discount on Amazon.My takes: the sound is hardcore, not sure what others are using but with my Galaxy Note 8 and Precise Volume app, this speaker's sound/quality range are excellent. After fully charging the battery, it's still going strong 7 hours later. Pairing is dumby proof. There's also a 3.5mm audio input for those without BT. Bose gives the speaker itself a USB-B mini input jack on the unit too.What I've noticed: the BT signal can be a bit sketchy. I have had my phone 20' from it and it would break up occasionally. I ensured my device was the only one with BT on. The Bose Connect app doesn't work with this SLM2 and that's just plain ridiculous.If you've got an Android phone with access to Google Play, download Precise Volume. You won't believe what kind of beast your phone or tablet will turn into and it translates to BT as well, making the Soundlink even more powerful.Hope this helps!","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2019",AETI3MHP3C3OGTUCNRU2CIR5XUXQ,True,3,Color: Black

This speaker is also a tank so don’t worry about accidental drops and falls with it because it’ll just shrug them off, no problem.On the flip side, the software inside is pretty finicky. The biggest Bluetooth problems usually occur within the first couple minutes of pairing. I’ve noticed that if my phone isn’t already playing music, pairing is not automatic. Also, it loves to pick up any device that has been connected in the past. For example, I usually play music from my iPhone, but it will frequently connect to my laptop (which is closed and shut down) while I’m streaming from my phone. Another problem is using the device until the battery dies. I frequently run it from 100% to dead. But once it dies and I plug it in to charge, it will not turn on Bluetooth until it is fully charged. So you need to be aware of battery life. Better to go 10 minutes without music while looking for the charger, versus playing it till dead and having to wait until it is fully charged again.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2018",AG5B2NCYGXGLKCYG2JXFJZVQ6IKQ,True,49,Color: Black

RX75C6NE7U6MZ,B01LZRFI5C,1.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound but Serious Design Flaw,Ted J. Wheeler,1,"I received my Bose Mini II Limted Edition today. The intent was to use it on the road as I am now and at home as a computer speaker. I have a set of Bose Companion 20 speakers which are amazing but I want less wiring and more real estate on my desk at home.Of course I will use the Bluetooth option occasionally but most of my applications will be with it hard wired to a computer or other source through the AUX port.Right away I noticed a problem. There is a horrible, loud hum (like a ground fault) when it has any source connected to AUX and the USB power source connected directly to the speaker or to the charging cradle.I attempted various sources, changing cables and power supplies, other electrical outlets, moving it around. The problem persists.Incidentally, my Logitech Bluetooth UE Mini Boom speakers and my Bose Companion 20's exhibit none of this connected to same source. It is not being carried in on the input. I tried multiple audio cables on multiple sources.If you unplug either the source connected or the USB power source, the hum stops.Then I went to Google to research this problem. Many people have observed it with all the Mini II's, but not the orginal Mini.Bose has no fix. It is a design flaw in the unit where they have not properly isolated the AUX input from the power. I read where some people found it went away if they powered/charged it off the USB port on their computer. The one I received won't do it. It starts to charge and then stops. The only option to use the AUX input is to run it on battery only.For my intended purpose this can't work. The speaker is amazing in terms of sound quality from such a small unit. But Bose really messed up with this one.I want to like it, was tempted to try to live with it but the point was to end up with Bose quality, not a serious quirk. One guy in a support thread said he undocks or slides the speaker off the cradle contacts a bit when he uses it direct connected to his computer.There are too many other good products out there so I am returning this to Amazon.

R1ADML7BY8MAI7,B01LZRFI5C,3.0 out of 5 stars short battery life. Probably not a good choice to be used as the office / desk speaker,Ruochi,3,"The battery will die. Not in a sense that it only lasts 1 hour instead of x hours as it used to. It will completely die. And because of the design, you cannot just use it with AC as power. It has to be used through battery, which probably explains why the battery dies so fast. For electronics with battery, a more appropriate design would be to use AC to directly support the machine when the power surpass the required number, and switch to battery when AC is off. But Bose choose to always use battery to support the machine, letting the battery being charged and used all the time... And as compared to soundlink mini1...the battery on mini2 is soldered on the chips and hard to change on your own. Note that the version one is a plug in-n-out design. THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE. It's harder to assemble, the size of the machine doesn't change, so there is actually no benefit on changing the design, except that now their customers are forced to either buy a new speaker every 2-3 years or pay ~100$ to get the battery changed.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2021",AF7YHHUB67DAEOPHDTXD5OPWMLUA,True,0,Color: Black

It arrived quickly and was sealed in the retail packaging. I quickly fired it up, connecting to my phone via Bluetooth was a breeze. The sound quality was great, by the best sounding portable speaker I've owned. I also liked that it easily detects and re-pairs with my phone, rather than my POS Jambox that I would have to turn on and off every time to reconnect. It has an annoying voice that prompts you that it is connected, but that can easily be disabled.The problem started when I tried connecting my mp3 player via the AUX input. It would play great for 5-10 minutes then the sound would cut out completely. It eventually comes back on, but keeps doing this intermittently. I tried playing from different devices with different cords, same result. Tried to update the firmware but it already had the latest version. Eventually this drove me insane, as it is completely unacceptable for a BRAND NEW item. Looking online, it seems there are scores of people with the same issue.I tried to go through the Amazon returns process which was a huge hassle because I had to schedule the pickup while I was leaving for a trip. They ended up taking it back and refunding me but did not send the replacement. And of course in the meantime the price has gone up $30. Forget it, I'm not taking that chance again. Bose really needs to improve their quality control.***UPDATE***After 2 years of constant use with the Bluetooth function, this speaker has now refused to take a charge when plugged in, so now can only be used while plugged in to AC power.

This newer mini soundlink has even better base and treble, plus if you have an Alexa, takes voice commands. I don’t have one but I do use this for my MS Teams and Zoom business calls and apparently I sound really good. Something else I discovered that Bose don’t write about is the when you’re in close proximity it simply brilliant and deep, rich base sounds playing music, but I walk away from it when I’m on the beach to cool off, you can’t hear it 8 feet away so I don’t annoy anyone near me.

The clarity and the range still surprises me when I listen to my old music where I am able to hear things I could not hear before because I've been, like most computer users, listening to music through cheap speakers which are good for nothing more than playing beeps and buzzes. Unfortunately well designed products are not cheap. Some things are worth the extra cost and these speakers are one of them. The portability is really handy although mine sits on my desk most the time next to my computer.The only issue I've had with this speaker is it shuts down if not in use and you have to reconnect it whenever you want some sound. And this Bluetooth reconnect process is awkward and difficult as you might already know. Not sure that is something you can blame on the device makers short of redesigning Bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2017",AFETNO4P47WUI4ORLVH376BDDB2Q,True,3,Color: Black/Copper

Only worry to be had are the buttons on the unit and the stiffness they bring. Wear on them over a shorter period of time than other units are always a possibility. Other worry is battery life being shorter than other speakers but sometimes quality has it's price. Our only other worry is what others have mentioned about charging problems after a short period of ownership of the speaker.

Bought this to take along for a several-month out of state contract job, since hauling my 60's all-tube audio gear, four vintage loudspeakers, turntable, and a bunch of vinyl LP's just wouldn't be practical. In short, this thing is pretty impressive in its volume and frequency response. It accurately reproduces modern digital content in all of its flat, cold, sterile glory, with a fair amount of punch. It paired to my Samsung phone flawlessly; in contrast, I spent over an hour getting it to talk to my Lenovo laptop (I'll blame that on the laptop, since the Bose snuggled right up to the phone). My main reservation is about the price; if you've got a spare couple hundred lying around, sure, but don't make your kids miss any meals for it. To be fair, Bose has always made good products; my old 301 Series II's are still favorites, especially for small-group jazz and such, and the Wave radios I've heard have been really strong. So, I'd recommend this thing for bedroom, office, or hotel-room use, background music at the pool, and so on, with a question mark (or exclamation point) hovering over the price tag.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2017",AFFYUWXMZJJXFFUSWC45XVTMBOXA,True,3,Color: Black/Copper

Bass response sounds natural and has none of the over-augmented low end often used with inferior products. Volume is more than adequate for general entertainment and can be clearly heard in a large room. We noticed some issues in maintain the Bluetooth connection if the phone gets too far from the speaker. I can't say this is an actual problem with the speaker or it is normal for Bluetooth (not an expert here). However, keeping the phone within 20 feet of the speaker is not an issue and it works well. We keep the speaker on the cradle and it stays in one place, so we cannot speak to battery life or portability.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2019",AGRJJ4MATA3G7URQQQDIAUJ443TA,True,0,Color: Black

It looks like a mini wave sound system but that thing is too big. The other models being offered at the time that this was didn’t compare because they were all too ugly and expensive.

The only nice thing about it is you can connect 2 devices.The charger docking station is poorly designed. You have a 50/50 chance that the speaker will engage the charger every time you dock it.The sound is o.k. but there are no sound control buttons. So, you can't adjust treble/base etc. The buttons on the speaker are rubbery and take effort to depress. The design feel old and outdated.My speaker had charging issues after 2 months while still under warranty. One reason I spent extra money to by Bose was I mistakenly assumed they would have top notch tech support. They do not. Basically, you can try using chat support but you are eventually going to end up calling them which is a hassle. And, they won't send you any email confirmation of the phone call so it's like it never happened.Bottom line is that I had to return the speaker for a warranty repair on June 15. Normally, under warranty the company will replace it with a new one. Instead they are doing a repair. Fine. But now they say the repair will not be done until September 3rd. So, that's is 2.5 months.

We love the battery life of these products you can play all day long at a fairly high volume and never run out of battery. You do have to control the lights from the W-KING app, on your phone. These lights are BRIGHT! It took us a minute to figure out how to turn the lights off to save battery. I can’t imagine anyone not being happy with this little speaker, I have no complaints about the function (except I’d prefer a lighter color). The speaker is covered with a type of fabric. At full volume, the sound is still crisp & clear. The BASS on this little guy is powerful! I chose the 40 W speaker because the clarity is just leaps and bounds of higher quality than the less expensive speakers I was looking at. That being said, I’ve read reviews where people traded in their more expensive portable speakers JBL and Sony for the W- king. One review that I read said that this is for “ music people“ we have had other brands of waterproof speakers, but the base was not there so they just sounded very thin.

No distortion just beautiful room filling sound and cannot wait to bring this with ice fishing this winter and to the lake in kayak or paddleboat this summer.. why this over 300 the 300 has worst distortion I've experienced in a speaker with volume at 70 percent or higher and that's without xbass on the m5 great little speaker but not how they have the speakers set up the flip 6 and charge 5 are impressive for bass but where they lack is in instrument separation and detail which is to be expected I guess being mono with only 1 tweeter in each speaker but what really burned me with the jbl as I bought two of the flip 6 is when paired in tws ya cannot actually customize sound in their garbage 3 band eq they keep it locked on flat sound cuz it gives what they say is best sound and that is pure garbage I will say for a bass head the charge 5 on sale is decent at 119 but this d320 is like a mix of those not quite as impressive bass but still very good especially considering the smaller size of this speaker vs something like a tribit blast where it excels is with the instrument separation man does this thing sound good with a Lil love thru their app using 10 band eq... I ain't into the lights but my 10 and 8 and 4 yr olds are so cool feature to have when they have friends over and we r all jamming to some tunes ... haven't gotten to fully test battery life but if it's like the d9 or x10 I'm guessing it will do what they claim as long as it isn't cranked at 100 percent volume and that's the other thing wking speakers always get loud and sound good but they finally did it with this app where not only does it get really really loud but it does so beautifully with zero distortion ... wking ya nailed it with this and can't wait till that x20 is available here in the states I will buy it immediately and this charge 5 is Goin back to target tomorrow,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AGQN2ZXSWLEH4ZFJ3ZBS5RXJP2ZA,True,7,Color: Blue

I even downloaded the app and tried to improve the sound. Is it a bad speaker, no it's not, but the sound quality to me is mostly on the high end, I don't hear the bass people raved about, it's weak at the higher levels for sure.UPDATE: I have updated my review and now offer four stars because of the feedback and customer service I have received from W-King, they offered a full refund and to allow me to keep the speaker. I'd actually already returned it , but I will admit I have been impressed by their customer service department. It's nice to know they are willing to try to make things right if you are dissatisfied with one of their products.

I watched reviews that made comments of why only one side had lights. Looks like they fixed that.Regarding their new app. Loaded app version 2.0.8. No issues downloading from play store and connecting to speaker. Features a 10 band eq with a optimistic 30hz control. They quote a frequency response down to 100hz but in testing it plays down to 62hz before dropping off.Light controls. Here's where i ran into an issue. Looks like you're supposed to be able to customize the RGB pattern but only can turn off/on and brightness at the moment. There's supposed to be a ""mode"" button but there isn't.I'll update later with my sound review.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AEMTSXRP4OD7EWYQ2QOQQH7DOYUQ,True,2,Color: Red
RVOVUXTIY09FG,B0CH9M7QVM,3.0 out of 5 stars Its okay,tyler,3,"I have another W-King speaker thats been pretty good to me so I figured I'd give this one a shot. The light show is super annoying, it switches between flashing, spinning, changing color every second that its more distracting than ""cool"". The only customization in the app is changing the brightness which isn't really customization to me.The speaker also locks up often to the point where I need to press the reset button on the inside of the speaker to get it to respond. This has happened when trying to change the volume, trying to pause music, turning on and off the lights, etc. The annoying part is when it locks up you can't even turn it off and reset it that way. The only way to get it to stop is either wait to see if it frees up itself or hit the reset button. I would prefer the reset button be more easily accessible on future models or even integrated into the power button because finding a thin piece of wire to press that button under the flap isn't ideal in normal use cases.The sound is probably the only redeeming part of the speaker. Its got good range and sounds decent enough. With the annoyances I have with it, I think I would rather spend the extra money and get the JBL product instead.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AFPXXBQC2RIVV5VEEZFZS7CWFOPQ,True,0,Color: Black

W-King products never disappoint!,Placeholder,5,"I’ve recently bought a stand-up paddleboard and want to be able to take my tunes with me. I researched and researched and researched and was so happy to find this WK portable speaker. We have bought two other beach radios from W-KING and pair them. We love the battery life of these products you can play all day long at a fairly high volume and never run out of battery. You do have to control the lights from the W-KING app, on your phone. These lights are BRIGHT! It took us a minute to figure out how to turn the lights off to save battery. I can’t imagine anyone not being happy with this little speaker, I have no complaints about the function (except I’d prefer a lighter color). The speaker is covered with a type of fabric. At full volume, the sound is still crisp & clear. The BASS on this little guy is powerful! I chose the 40 W speaker because the clarity is just leaps and bounds of higher quality than the less expensive speakers I was looking at. That being said, I’ve read reviews where people traded in their more expensive portable speakers JBL and Sony for the W- king. One review that I read said that this is for “ music people“ we have had other brands of waterproof speakers, but the base was not there so they just sounded very thin. Search no more, you found your perfect portable speaker!

I bought this for it's waterproof rating as a beach and travel speaker. The claimed battery life is ambitious but acceptable, I was getting around seven hours at 60% volume with the lights off.The rubber port seal began to crumble and ultimately fell off, rendering this unit useless to me for it's intended purpose. I contacted “customer service"" to get a replacement seal & after many emails they offered an apology & a 10$ discount. Among many BT speakers I have, including two D9-1s, I can't recommend W-King ever again. Now this D320 can stay in the house for podcasts, no more beach life.UPDATEW-King contacted me about this review and offered a full refund.

The app with 10 band eq is great the sound and power this thing produces is legit powerful. No distortion just beautiful room filling sound and cannot wait to bring this with ice fishing this winter and to the lake in kayak or paddleboat this summer.. why this over 300 the 300 has worst distortion I've experienced in a speaker with volume at 70 percent or higher and that's without xbass on the m5 great little speaker but not how they have the speakers set up the flip 6 and charge 5 are impressive for bass but where they lack is in instrument separation and detail which is to be expected I guess being mono with only 1 tweeter in each speaker but what really burned me with the jbl as I bought two of the flip 6 is when paired in tws ya cannot actually customize sound in their garbage 3 band eq they keep it locked on flat sound cuz it gives what they say is best sound and that is pure garbage I will say for a bass head the charge 5 on sale is decent at 119 but this d320 is like a mix of those not quite as impressive bass but still very good especially considering the smaller size of this speaker vs something like a tribit blast where it excels is with the instrument separation man does this thing sound good with a Lil love thru their app using 10 band eq... I ain't into the lights but my 10 and 8 and 4 yr olds are so cool feature to have when they have friends over and we r all jamming to some tunes ... haven't gotten to fully test battery life but if it's like the d9 or x10 I'm guessing it will do what they claim as long as it isn't cranked at 100 percent volume and that's the other thing wking speakers always get loud and sound good but they finally did it with this app where not only does it get really really loud but it does so beautifully with zero distortion ... wking ya nailed it with this and can't wait till that x20 is available here in the states I will buy it immediately and this charge 5 is Goin back to target tomorrow,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AGQN2ZXSWLEH4ZFJ3ZBS5RXJP2ZA,True,7,Color: Blue

I even downloaded the app and tried to improve the sound. Is it a bad speaker, no it's not, but the sound quality to me is mostly on the high end, I don't hear the bass people raved about, it's weak at the higher levels for sure.UPDATE: I have updated my review and now offer four stars because of the feedback and customer service I have received from W-King, they offered a full refund and to allow me to keep the speaker. I'd actually already returned it , but I will admit I have been impressed by their customer service department. It's nice to know they are willing to try to make things right if you are dissatisfied with one of their products.

I watched reviews that made comments of why only one side had lights. Looks like they fixed that.Regarding their new app. Loaded app version 2.0.8. No issues downloading from play store and connecting to speaker. Features a 10 band eq with a optimistic 30hz control. They quote a frequency response down to 100hz but in testing it plays down to 62hz before dropping off.Light controls. Here's where i ran into an issue. Looks like you're supposed to be able to customize the RGB pattern but only can turn off/on and brightness at the moment. There's supposed to be a ""mode"" button but there isn't.I'll update later with my sound review.","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AEMTSXRP4OD7EWYQ2QOQQH7DOYUQ,True,2,Color: Red
RVOVUXTIY09FG,B0CH9M7QVM,3.0 out of 5 stars Its okay,tyler,3,"I have another W-King speaker thats been pretty good to me so I figured I'd give this one a shot. The light show is super annoying, it switches between flashing, spinning, changing color every second that its more distracting than ""cool"". The only customization in the app is changing the brightness which isn't really customization to me.The speaker also locks up often to the point where I need to press the reset button on the inside of the speaker to get it to respond. This has happened when trying to change the volume, trying to pause music, turning on and off the lights, etc. The annoying part is when it locks up you can't even turn it off and reset it that way. The only way to get it to stop is either wait to see if it frees up itself or hit the reset button. I would prefer the reset button be more easily accessible on future models or even integrated into the power button because finding a thin piece of wire to press that button under the flap isn't ideal in normal use cases.The sound is probably the only redeeming part of the speaker. Its got good range and sounds decent enough. With the annoyances I have with it, I think I would rather spend the extra money and get the JBL product instead.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AFPXXBQC2RIVV5VEEZFZS7CWFOPQ,True,0,Color: Black

REPT12N1Z65B,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Tribit Stormbox Blast,BLRG,5,"Arrived yesterday and connected it straight away. Had 60% charge on arrival and excellent packaging. Sound blows away the Soundcore Motion Boom + (in my opinion) which I tried first but was just not able to get the deeper bass and despite watching all the videos and reviews and eq recommendations was not able to get the deep bass or anything close to the Tribit also was not able to reduce the screechy highs on the MB+. My son has the HK Onyx studio 6 and when comparing the MB+ to the studio 6 the only area the MB+ wins is it gets louder but the sound is no where near the shear richness or quality of the Studio 6. This Tribit has the deep bass and smooth richness but can also get loud and also sounds great on lower volumes as well - normally listen at 30%-40%. We are using it as a sound bar for our TV right now and watched a couple movies last night. WOW what a difference. Was like being at the cinema - the rumble on the lows! The bluetooth is easy to connect and only small issue is delay when flipping between tv, phone & laptop bluetooth. Was flipping between multiple devices simultaneously, Was testing with youtube videos from the laptop, movies on TV and music from my phone as well as playing with the tribit app & settings. I think it is only supposed to connect to two devices at a time but irrespective it was only slight delay flipping between 3 devices - between 2-3 seconds. The sound and deep bass is so good for its size and I know many talk of it being heavy but its not heavy to me, feels right and solid - not cheap -but quality. It is super easy to carry around and will be great for the boat / lake and beach. It is warm and rich sounding with plenty of customization. Will see how the battery does over time and how it keeps performing but so far very impressed. Started the morning with the battery at 100% and shows on the app. As soon as the light on the unit showed it was filly charged the app said 100%. Lights on it are bright- nice to have but I keep them turned off. Nice thing is they still show when adjusting the volume even when light display is off. Have had it on today non-stop for 12 hours so far playing between 40 - 60% volume - lights off - working as a TV sound bar and for streaming music. I am still showing 60%. Will see how long it keeps going.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2023",AF5F2GNRXCRVAOOCW36TN7IGGNWA,True,40,

I was a little worried about trying a non-name-brand speaker, but after consulting some forums, I took a chance. The sound is juicy and has good bass. I downloaded the updated sound enhancements and am very happy with it. The battery lasts a lot longer than you'd expect and is quite loud. I usually keep it around half volume and works great both indoor and outdoor. Its got some heft, but the quality of the construction feels solid and I love the boom-box aesthetic.

RZN1X5HHIPU79,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable price/performance! Has 3.5 mm aux input!,Corndog,5,"Sure, it's a bit weighty, but I'd rather that and have nice, beefy sound, than to have it be light and have a less substantial sound. But you may differ. If you are one of those people, you may prefer the Motion Boom Plus by Soundcore. I got a chance to test out both in person, and personally, like many, I went with the Blast.The Motion Boom Plus can be tuned for an elegant sound, but its limited EQ in the app kills what could be much better. I was able to get richer, lower reaching bass out of it using a 3rd party app, but it took much work what was existent out off the box with the Blast - and much more substantial at that! The retro-looking RGB side lights are icing on the cake. Very cool to look at, and adds a unique effect.As for sound, I usually opt for flat, neutral tunes when it comes to my monitors and headphones, but I wanted a fun, boomy ""travel"" speaker (more like 'road-trip speaker) that was competent with the bass. Not only is it clean and punchy, it can reach down surprisingly low for such small drivers. The mids and highs are nothing to write home about, but they aren't terrible. They're serviceable. Mids are a bit recessed, dry, and resist drastic tuning, but can be slightly brightened to bring the tracks alive. Could be better, but not bad, and doesn't ruin the sound of the speaker. I'll also add here that I wouldn't have purchased this speaker if it did not have the 3.5 mm aux input, so good on Tribit for including that.Battery life is also phenomenal, but prepare to lose just a tiny bit in the power of the sound when unplugged. I honestly prefer that approach, as I value sound quality over portability. If it's relatively close while on battery, but gets a nice boost plugged in, hooray for that! In the end, I suppose it's how you look at it; lose power when unplugged for portability vs get a boost when plugged in - I see it the second way because I'm used to the philosophy that there is always a sacrifice for portability.Right now the Stormbox Blast is priced 40% off its original price at $155.98. That's awesome, especially when you consider that the less capable, yet lighter Motion Boom Plus is price $5 more. It's really going to come down to your preferences and personal needs. But if it's for a more powerful sound, a flashier look and presence, then this one is going to be it in this price range.","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2023",AHFFS52VKVXLX27S2JJMXWFDQ5AA,True,55,
RWUVNJD6SC9JC,B09PMYTJD2,4.0 out of 5 stars Great initial quality,SuperBlindGirl,4,"Writing this review from one blind person's perspective.I have purchased other Tribit speakers, namely the storm box. I was very happy with it, so when I wanted some thing bigger and louder for outdoors, I gravitated toward this blast. Based on my experience with the storm box, which is a smaller less powerful speaker, I was hoping the blast would afford the same features. There were some similarities, but some drawbacks as well. It is not a larger version of the storm box. It does have somewhat of a similar feel, same shape only larger, but sports a handle on the top as it is much heavier than I would have expected. I assume this is due to the significantly larger battery which allows for long playtime, lighting, and the ability to charge other devices from the speaker. Well it is noticeably heavy, it is not overwhelmingly heavy. Unlike the storm box, do not expect 360° sound from this speaker. It only projects forward. What I liked about the storm box were large easy to find volume and play pause buttons. The buttons to control the speaker are on the top in front of the handle in a row. While they do have some tactile markings, they are not as pronounced as the storm box, and are much smaller buttons. They can easily blend together. I would have liked to see bigger and better marked buttons considering the large size of this speaker. Similarly to the storm box, the controls only allow for volume up and down and play pause. There are not controls to skip tracks or fast forward. I really would like to see this feature added to their line of products as it would be extremely helpful, so is one drawback to the brand. One cool thing is that you can download the Tribit app, which I did on my iPhone, and this allows for full control of the speaker, including lights, equalizer, and volume controls. I have been using the speaker outside, and I think that is where it excels. It definitely sounds good inside, but definitely seems made for the outdoors. I appreciate that it is water resistant, and it has decently deep base which I also appreciate. The lighting has two different modes, which with my extremely low vision I can barely make out but I'm sure keep things interesting for those who can see. You can control the lights either from the app or using the button on the speaker itself. You can also turn on and off the base boost on the speaker itself or in the app. There are more equalizer options within the app . I don't have much of a very discerning ear I guess, because I have a hard time distinguishing between the difference of bass boost and party modes, but the sound quality is good. The biggest and best surprise for me was that when I used Bluetooth to connect this speaker to my iPhone to play music, the music played on the speaker, but voiceover was only coming out of my phone. I actually love this because it allows me to control the music from my phone accessibly but not interrupt the music. I wish every speaker would do this! my storm box speakers don't seem to have this functionality and I have not experienced it with any other brands of speakers. This made me very happy! I was able to purchase the speaker on sale, which made the price tag a lot more palatable. So my recommendation would be to watch for that! it is definitely overall a solid speaker and worth checking out, especially if you have vision issues.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2024",AFIUWEUUEJPYZ2Z6F3WRP6TBHVOA,True,0,
R1AYDTW2QVE2T,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbelievable Deal!,Chad Czternastek,5,"The media could not be loaded. I budgeted $210 to buy this in a month or two. I seen it on Amazon for $150 and I jumped on the deal. My friend has one so I heard the sound that comes from the speakers. The sub-woofers are built into the flanking sides. It hurts to touch it when you got bass going on.The sound that comes out the speakers is so good. So crisp, so clean, just as good as a Bose if not better. Unless you are one of those who want the expensive, hi-fidelity stuff, these will more than do.Some people complain about the weight but I think it builds into a big space of speakers into a dense set of small speakers combining into 90W. It weighs 12 pounds which don't seem like a lot but you initially expect it to be lighter, and you instantly realize all the weight is the dense design. Only issue I could complain about, if I had to find one, is the battery life. The ads and descriptions say it has so many hours, and they figure that time at super low settings. When you use this at the ideal volume, you are not going to get as much as you think. As I said, if I had to complain it would be that. For me, I listen to music on it, and lasts me two to three days. That's a couple hours, a few there. But if you have it plugged in, you have no worries. 8-10 hours total I would say is realistic.If you get this and like to listen to remastered music, which seems to be the accepted way to cash in on a already successful record. You can tell cause the music quality is top tier. You hear the little things that you don't normally hear. I think listening to the sound, you need to use the pre-set equalizer settings based on the music type. I have no clue on how to use an equalizer but using the pre-set ones you can tell when switching.What makes this so great is how music is bought now compared to a decade and beyond. Used to be you hear a couple songs off an album, you go pay $20 for the record. Now, you pay $10 to Amazon Music or Spotify and you have almost full access to any album, ever. You can discover new music on this. The quality is good enough to invest more time into the great art of music. I've read you can have more then one connected at the same time.Best value of anything I ever got. This is so worth it at retail price but you can usually catch it for $199 or less if you look or find the right deal. I've had a set of speakers well over $500 total that don't sound as good as this. If you are thinking about investing in some speakers, and stream from Bluetooth, I can save you time. Of course if you are looking to get very high quality speakers, and higher level of wattage and thump, you are gonna pay more but this does the job.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AFZDMTNFX6AMFWXYZTFNRWAB34WA,True,8,
R2BIG9HUD363LX,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars outstanding sound quality,damon,5,"I really appreciate the reviews I came across that recommended this - they were absolutely spot on! I have several different portable/ bluetooth speakers to compare this to, new and older - and it is very impressive.

After looking into the different options, we ended up trying/ getting a few (all of which exceeded the old Altec and the tiny Angle 3).The Bugani Shock is smaller, lighter & much cheaper than the Tribit - it sounds good for its size, can get pretty loud and stays clear, but its not in the same league by a large margin. I had tried the W-King D-10 - its bigger than the Bugani, but smaller & lighter than the Tribit - and priced in the middle of them as well. Again, it sounds good, gets loud, stays clear, had much more bass and had a bigger overall sound stage than the Bugani - but still not on the same scale as this Tribit. I recently got the Klipsch Groove XXL - and sound quality wise, they are extremely close - maybe the Klipsch having a little more detail, the Tribit has a bit more bass - but both have unreal scale, especially for being relatively small, portable speakers. How much bass the Tribit puts out is really impressive for its size - all while having a very balanced overall sound.I havent found out the limit of the battery life yet - but I have played it at around 60-80% volume for several hours continuously w/ no problems.We ended up getting a 2nd Tribit recently when they were on sale - I tried them together in stereo - they work seamlessly and sounds that much better.I could easily give a recommendation for either the Tribit or Klipsch - they're similar size, the Tribit is a little heavier but has a better handle... Finding each on sale - the Tribit is around $20 cheaper... The Klipsch has a remote... I couldnt find any waterproof/ resistance rating for the Klipsch, while the Tribit is IPX7 rated, etc.... I dont believe a better option is available at this time for a speaker under $200 - I did my best to find it.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AEJ7MGTSJ6ICFUTZIAMMCNLF7USA,True,3,

RJFFRUZIKDIQP,B09PMYTJD2,"5.0 out of 5 stars Full, LOUD Sound Even in Open Spaces",Teknogk,5,"I have been eying up the JBL BOOMBOX 3 for a while since I love my Charge 4 but I wanted something that filled the yard with sound and carried good bass. The Boombox 3 seemed to be the ticket but man, that price is high.I stumbled onto a review for this Tribit StormBox on YouTube from German guy who had these two side by side on an open basketball court while his son was zooming around a few RC cars. He switched between these two testing the volume, bass, using different music and the difference was remarkable. Unfortunately that video has disappeared but I was impressed enough to look into this and give it a try and when I saw this had a $40 coupon bringing it to $160 I jumped. I was not disappointed!The sound is great, the battery is phenomenal (without running the LEDs and at about 50-75% volume), and a few people who have heard it were very impressed. I had three long 6-8 hours days in the yard and each night forgot to take it in when I only had one and charge it and on the 4th day I thought I might be in trouble lasting all day but checked the app and it still had 40% charge!I loved it so much I purchased a second one so I could run them in stereo mode as a left and right speaker! It also works in 'serial' mode so both speakers are connected and both playing the same music in stereo if they are spread apart too far to have a left and right speaker.UPDATE!!! I thought is was able to play in 'serial' mode which the speaker said it was in but it is still only left and right when connected. I didn't really notice it with the music I was playing but caught on after some music with more separation. I reached out to Tribit on this and they said it only paired in stereo mode but not at all a deal breaker but it would be nice to have this feature.The nice touch for using them together is that once linked they remember the mode you are connected in (stereo or serial) so when you turn them on they link together again automatically. The volume of both is controlled by my phone so they both go up and down with the one control and if you turn one off when connected the other powers down as well. The only slightly negative things I have with this is sometimes if my phone is on me in my pocket and I am working at a lower level in the yard behind a retaining wall the Bluetooth can get a little spotty but works fine when I leave the yard and go in the house and even stays connected if I go into the front yard.The other thing I would like to see is some sort of visual indicator of the battery life on the speaker itself, maybe adding that as an option when cycling the LED modes. As of now I need to open the app to check the battery.The app is only OK but getting better as I have had a 3-4 updates to it since my first one was ordered in March.Beyond that I really could not be happier with this purchase and I have two of them new ($320 with a $40 coupon for each and STILL currently available as of 7/31/24) for significantly less than a single JBL Boombox 3 new ($500) or 'renewed' ($375).I am no super geek audiophile but to me and many others that have heard this it sounds great to us and really fills the yard with sound and good bass so I highly recommend this speaker!","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AHSIGPKSADGJ3Y3ARZDGYVQBQYBA,True,4,
R1M5UBI9XI0S16,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars My review vs soundcore boom 2 plus,John,5,"So quickly going over the differencesThe weight. The soundcore isn't light, but the tribit is noticeably heavierAppearance. I personally like the soundcore. For both I don't like the lights. I'm sure they drain battery and I just don't care for them.Sound. To me, out of the box, the soundcore just sounds downright bad. I immediately wanted to return it upon hearing it. That's actually why I bought the tribit, yeah it sounds that bad. The tribit took a few days to arrive and during that time I played with the soundcore. I found some random guys eq and it made things definitely better. The soundcore is a lot newer and I didn't find many eq online.... Or maybe I just don't know where to find them. I'm posting mine that I'm slowly tweaking, but sounds a million times better than what it comes with. I have no idea why soundcore launched what that preset. As for the tribit it sounds much better right out of the box with stock preset. So if you hear comparison videos online like I did, the tribit is just going to sound better, hands down, but doesn't have a ton of room to get better (from my experience)From here I'm comparing using my posted eq for soundcore b2+ and Alan Ross eq for tribit. Keep in mind I'm no audiophile nor do I know the terminology that well.The sound is pretty similar. What jumps or to me is that in things like rock music, the soundcore has like this noise. I'm not sure if muddy is the word, but it sounds like some sounds can just run together, doesn't sound super clean. It doesn't sound awful, just switching back and forth with the tribit, it's noticable. The tribit on the other hand just doesn't have that... It's like it's just not there, it's cleaner. But when listening to volume around 60%+ I can hear the tribit distorting, which doesn't happen on the soundcore.On louder volumes, that muddy or whatever sound on the soundcore kinda makes it feel full, kinda like a concert or something. When the tribit is turned all the way up, I mean it doesn't sound bad, but it sounds a little more empty. It's hard to explain, but that's all I can do. I don't know if it is, but it makes the soundcore sound a lot louder. It's more fun to sing along to at high volumes(drowns out my own voice more lol)My suggestion is if this is for outdoor use/you wanna jam out at high volume and sing along to, get the soundcore. If you want cleaner music for lower volumes especially inside, get the tribit.The both pump it crazy amounts of bass. Since I'm using mine virtually 100% outdoor, the soundcore is what I'm keeping","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AGUC7ZJPKZD6VBLUFWETB2ILOJDA,True,3,
R3A5OMLEB9E0OA,B09PMYTJD2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Heavy, and no phone calls, but music is great",Dman,4,"I struggled between getting this Tribit Stormbox, or the W-King 80w, for months. I got this tribit instead of the W, since I have had and still have 4 or 5 ? Tribit devices (from earbuds to Stormbox Micro 2), and their sound is always good, they dont lie about how long their devices will play for, they dont lie about bass, their usb ports have NEVER gone out on me because they were loose or cheaply made/applied, and their tech support is as good as Anker is (top 2 support companies on Amazon says me and many others), and also the Tribit was 10w louder, lol.Anyway, the 1st thing I did with this was charge it, 2nd was play music on it.Most of my music I have is mids/high type, and this didnt disappoint me much about a softer bass. BUT, for those musicians who I do like with lots of bass, I was thinking: man, this is kinda low bass. THEN I remembered there was a Bass Boost button! And man, when you hit that thing, it is perfect (to my ears, and for no$5k setup mind you). The Bass Boost REALLY does boost the bass, without drowning out the mids and highs. Dont ask me how the do it, but they do.The wireless reaction time from my phone is instantaneous on this boombox (unlike the micro 2, which has about a .5 second delay).I have been trying to get my computer speakers to work on my tv because there isnt any bass since the speaker bar wireless bass/rears went out, so I hooked this Tribit boombox to my TV ! LOL Funny thing is, is that it actually works, even though I still have the speaker bar hooked into my tv. It takes a few minutes to get the speaker bar and the Tribit to sound evenly (since I have the Tribit next to my bed between my tv with speaker bars and the Tribit acting as bass and Left Rear, lol), but once it does man does it sound good. There is a little delay when my tv is paired with the Tribit, but I know its from me having an old tv, with wireless 3.x or 4.0 max, and also with 2 sound bars hooked up to it (man I wish my 1st sound bar bass/rear didnt go out on me. I cant afford another $700 to $1100 for just a sound bar bass and rear).Anyway, this Tribit is 'almost' what I was looking for, so here comes the Negs/Wishes.]There is NO Remote control. Why not? Because we should be able to stand up every time we change the channel, or the next song is blaringly loud, or too soft, or we actually want to have a conversation with someone next to us and its too loud? Very big missed chance here, assuming we will just use our phones to sound up/down? You have to find the right loudness on both the Tribit and the whatever-it-is you are doing on the phone to have to turn it up/down also? What about when we are on a call, and cant turn the Tribit off, higher or lower? Oh, just turn your music off from the phone you are talking on! Right.......When I turn the Tribit lights off, I dont want to have to turn them off EVERY time I adjust the volume on it. Big mistake having the lights tuned to the Tribit sound up/down (when you physically have to get up, go to the Tribit box, find the sound button, turn it up or down, go back to where you were and see if it is loud enough or not, and keep doing that all day/night long? What about when you arent using your phone, and have music on a usb thumb drive? Way too many scenarios where a remote control would have upped this a star. No way. Another reason why a remote is good in these situations. On, Off, Up, Down sound, turn lights off completely (heck, put a light bar on the remote, so we can see if it is topping out or not), Last song, Next song. Not much to ask for, right? A remote control goes a LONG way on a limited product like this.Did I say this thing is heavy? It really is. I had an older product like this, with more features, that weighed 1/2 or less than this Tribit. A carrying strap would have been nice! Or a bag? Or something, even rubber handle over the plastic would make hauling this around much nicer.Did I say Limited? Yes, I did. This tribit does 2 things, play music from app and lights. Thats it. No Radio (I know, only us old folk listen to the radio). No cd player. No Time/Day/Date etc (would be nice to be able to use this as an Alarm clock. USB port for thumb drives? Port for sd/micro sdhc cards?Power bank? What device is NOT more portable for a power bank? Or even less pricey? I have a 5 hour bank charger I got for $30 that will power my phone longer than this thing when it is not plugged in, lol. Although, I did say they never lie about their products run time, and 30 hours IS a long time, so maybe a power bank is ok, except most of us have our phones in our hands, on a 1/4 pound or less charger if need be, not laying next to a digital dj, heh. Seems this was just one of those Checkbox 'features' because there arent any features (mostly because that would require a remote control for? maybe).AUX In? Hello, phones dont have a 3.5mm port anymore. Or are we supposed to tie ourselves to the Tribit, yet again, and carry a 3.5mm to usb-c cable around? Maybe we could put it in the Tribit carry bag...Oh, wait, there isnt one. Heh.Overall, for what I use it for, its almost perfect. And it seems W-K is going down this road now also with their new lineup (I was choosing between this and the squared W-K back before the new sleeker W-K came out). Except for a remote control, just to turn up or lower volume, and turn it on off (basically a remote that has the buttons on top of the Stormbox, this thing is almost perfect for me, except when I have to lug it somewhere else in the room. Tribit does 2 things VERY well, and those are Sound quality which this has, and real Time mentioned on how long it runs, which is usually on the lower side rather than the higher side. And Tech Support, so 3 things. I havent needed support for this Stormbox, so its 2 for now.Recommended?Yes. If you are strong enough to lug this thing around, just want to play great sounding music outside while you sit, or do yardwork, or have lots of parties. Oh, also if you want to use it for your tv speakers instead of the tinny sounding wimpy ones that come with tv's nowadays, lol.I almost gave it 5 stars, it is that good, but w/o a remote control and very limited use, I just cant give it a 5.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2023",AH5TKVDNNG6H27AILTCIDTCUCXEQ,True,24,
R2CEBO9M8ZDN0S,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars A MOVIE THEATER SPEAKER to have at home.,"Terry Wilkerson, Jr.",5,"The media could not be loaded. The packaging and the expedient of the arrival of my speaker arrived on time and were in great condition. I wasn't expecting all of the box and foam that came inside this to keep it well protected. I love that.Now, this is my second introduction to Tribit and I really love this company and this speaker specifically I really, really love beyond infinity. I wish I could give this speaker more than 5 stars because this is amazing.I had my first Tribit StormBox Blast delivered on June 23 for my personal testing since I mostly use the speakers I have (Tribit and JBL) for movies and very little for music and the second one I got on June 30 this year (2024). Let me tell you that the performance of just 1 Tribit StormBox Blast is out of this world. When I was testing my speaker inside of my house at 50% volume within ear shot, oh my God. This speaker is a literal movie theater speaker and that is mostly because of the XBass button on the top of it and even without it on it still gives off that impression. I was testing the Alien: Romulus teaser trailer since that is the best option to use and when I went to the theaters a month before I got this speaker, I remembered the sound and everything when they showed the preview for it and it sounds exactly like the theatrical experience. I am not exaggerating when this speaker was literally shaking my room, with or without my door closed and that I could feel the wind from it. I do not believe it is advertised as a movie theater speaker but it is indeed that. Amazing job Tribit. I suppose that the size of the speaker is why it able to do that but I digress.I love bright colors and the appearance of the LED lights I love and this speaker is very easy to use. As you can see, I have put a video of my 1st speaker at the time and the connectivity of this speaker is 150 feet and I could hear the music and dialog from movies from that far away as if you were a little bit closer to it. It does start cutting out when you are pass the 150 ft. mark but if you have your phone connected to it, I suggest leaving it by the speaker and go the distance you want to go. I had to be at least 200 ft plus and I could hear everything very clearly and I had the speaker at max volume in order for that to work and the phone in the idea I mentioned. It really makes up the size for this speaker and the speaker is 12 pounds but is not heavy to me at all.I test and watch only movies with my speakers and now I have a second one of this speaker and I love it. Godzilla Minus One I tested when I watched the movie for the first time and yeah this is a movie theater speaker and I didn't see that movie in theaters but I know that is what that sounds like. Transformers 2007 I remember every sound when I saw that in theaters and that is exactly how it sounds and even more so. This speaker cost $200 but here on Amazon you can get a 40% discount and it bumps it to $160 to $170 depending on your shipping prefence. This is the best speaker I have ever gotten and do not intend on getting any other speaker. This speaker does have 30 hours of battery life as advertised but it is mostly due to the LED lights being shut off. With the lights it 24 hours or almost less. I watched three 2 hour movies and the Tribit app, in which you can customize the volume for this speaker, the battery was still at 70% or 50% left and that was with the lights and not plugged in. This is the best speaker I have ever purchased and have and I would highly recommend it. Especially if you love movies like me or if you really love music like me also. I wish there was more to elaborate on but this speaker is a BEAST.","Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2024",AEGNH2USRR4LWRJMJHPQ2XGPZ6BA,True,2,
R37HN5S0QF9JGH,B09PMYTJD2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Like A $500 JBL Boombox, Can't Be Used In The Shower",Chase,4,"TLDR: Loud as hell, sounds great, plastics feel cheap, not so good at low volume, cannot handle prolonged splashes and sprays. Buy if you want something loud and cheap, don't buy for your shower or outdoor adventures.I bought this speaker due to its high rankings among various reviewers, and am blown away by the sound quality for a speaker around 1/3 the price of its closest competitor (the JBL Boombox series).My friends and I did a side-by-side sound test of the Tribit Stormbox Blast vs a JBL Boombox 2 and found them to be nearly indistinguishable at high volume. Both speakers play loud enough to be uncomfortable for extended indoor use and experience no noticeable distortion or clipping at maximum volume. Default EQ settings of the Tribit vs the JBL are different but both speakers allow for enough customization to suit most users' needs.To sound that good for 1/3 the cost, however, some cuts did have to be made. The two most noticeable are the build quality of the speaker and its low-volume performance. The Tribit speaker is heavy and feels as bulky as it sounds, but is constructed out of cheap-feeling plastic compared to the ""luxurious"" fabric and rubber overwrap on the JBL Boombox. This makes the speaker easier to dry, put stickers on, or attach third-party mounts to but does look and feel cheap.Low-volume performance is also significantly worse than that of the JBL, mostly due to the Tribit only having 16 volume levels. The gaps between them at low volumes are HUGE compared to those on smaller speakers (think five or six levels on something you could fit in your hand) and I personally find many situations where the only volume options are too quiet or too loud for low-volume use. This can be combatted by disabling Bluetooth absolute volume on your source device or using a source which does not support absolute volume (AUX input or older Bluetooth device). Both the Tribit and the JBL sound less clear and refined at lower volume than most smaller speakers, this is not a design flaw but rather an inherent property of speaker sizing.Another major drawback of the Tribit speaker compared to its more expensive competitors is its poor water resistance. The speaker is rated at IPX7 and can be submerged in water for short periods of time but will malfunction if exposed to splashes or spray for an extended period of time (use outdoors in the rain, inside a shower enclosure, etc). This malfunction usually involves the speaker quickly increasing to maximum volume while the controls fail to respond to inputs and appears to be caused by the use of a paper-based adhesive gasket to secure the control panel's rubber insert into the speaker body. For my use case this is a HUGE drawback but is something I am willing to deal with given the speaker's incredible performance as a high-volume boombox.Other aspects of the speaker mostly work as advertised. I have used the app to update firmware and it has worked without issue. Stereo mode works as well, with no apparent audio delay and full synchronization of the controls and lighting between the speakers. The lack of aptX support for a device with Bluetooth 5.3 hardware is quite unusual but I cannot hear a difference in audio quality, at least when streaming music through Spotify on a run-of-the-mill Android phone. I have yet to fully test battery life but the advertised figures appear accurate, at least based off the battery level shown in the app.In conclusion, I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a LOUD Bluetooth speaker, assuming your use case won't involve getting the speaker very wet. If you need a speaker which can be continuously used in wet environments, consider the JBL Boombox instead.Notes:- Ingress protection ratings are cumulative (e.g. a device rated at IPX5 is also rated at IPX4 and so on) only through level 6. Although most devices which can handle short-term submersion can also handle continuous splashes and sprays, it is possible to create one which cannot. Tribit is not making incorrect claims about the water resistance of their speaker (The Stormbox Blast does appear to meet IPX7 standards) but is rather advertising it in a way which may be misleading to some consumers.- Several of the issues with this speaker could be addressed through a firmware update, adding support for aptX Bluetooth audio, increasing the number of volume levels, etc. Given that the speaker has already received several firmware updates and is relatively new, I expect Tribit to improve on its functionality through future updates.- The water resistance of the speaker could be massively enhanced with some modifications. Several teardowns and analyses are available on the Internet as of the writing of this review, and the speaker is designed well from a water-resistance standpoint minus the issues with the control panel. I personally believe that a ""control panel protector"" could be installed on the top of the speaker and that this would allow it to handle splashes and sprays without issue.- The built-in power supply inside the speaker is massively convenient (makes the charger MUCH smaller than that of the JBL boombox) and is powerful enough to run the speaker at maximum volume continuously. Some other competitors (namely the Anker Soundcore Motion Boom Plus) do not have enough input power capacity to keep up with sustained high-volume use while plugged in. This is a big plus for the Tribit if your speaker will be used in a gym, dance studio, party house, or other situation where it'll rarely see low-volume or battery-operated use.- Most Bluetooth speakers which are covered in lights look cheap and tacky. Tribit does their lighting well, it is not obnoxious and can be turned off if desired. Several other reviewers have seen this as an issue but I personally have no problem with it.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2022",AGA6HJKPR346HRGADEFB22LP7V3A,True,141,

The bass you get for the size is the best I've ever heard, and the max volume on thise device is more than I've ever needed. The battery life is probably the best part, because I've never had to charge it after a single extended use case, I was able to get multiple hour long sessions out of the device which far beats any other speaker I've ever owned which only have enough juice for a couple hours.","Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2024",AERN57C3NFEDCXUEORU2KYD6MCEA,True,1,

After watching some YouTube reviews I decided on the Tribit Stormbox Blast. My hope was that it would sound very comparable to the JBL Boombox since I've heard that one in person and was super impressed with the sound quality. While the Tribit sounds good, it's not at the same level of performance as the JBL especially at lower volumes. After reading so many positive reviews I had higher expectations on how it would sound. I feel the clarity and bass are much better with the JBL. With that said, the price point of the Tribit is substantially less which was a deciding factor in my purchase.

This speaker performs amazing and is so easy to use. It has a Bluetooth connect button, volume controls, button to turn the lights off and one for more bass.

R31R54V3YVDVS2,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Beastly Box with great low frequencies. App EQ availability is a plus,Vic,5,"The media could not be loaded. Over the years I’ve own many speakers from small to large. I was also a nightclub stagehand and sound guy for years and now with technology getting better and better everything that you use to have to pay an arm and leg for you can get for a fair price. I always wanted to get a bluetooth speaker that has it all, this one is for sure “bang for your buck”. A great value for sure. I’ve had it for about 2 months and I hope it’ll last. Time will tell, but I’m still smiling from the day I took it out of the box. I listen to music everywhere and when my living space tv’s sound got dull this added so much life back to the experiences while watching shows and films. I’m thinking to myself if this was out a half decade before it would of been an easier decision to not spend sixteen hundred on a home theatre system.Out of the box the EQs are not for everyone, pretty good for what they are. Being able to adjust it is a smart move on the company’s part. I included pictures of a universal “U” shape eq setting if you think the “music” or “xbass” eqs are lacking in the highs. this will bring the out bass without drowning out everything else. It’s a nice balance for most genres that need the low and high end to shine (dance, hip hop, latin, meditation, rock).Weighs about 12-15lbs.The battery life claims are probably based on lights off with volume on lowest setting, which isn’t a lie but useless, unless you’re in a sound proof room.With 2 nights of full sleep without interruption I get about a good 16 hours on 30% volume on charge with lights off on my u shape eq with heavy bass before the low battery warning comes on.Updates through the app are easy and simple. The lights are fun but basic with only two settings. Hopefully they add more later. I love this speaker and have nothing to really complain about. I don’t mind the look, feel, weight, size, or anything about it, but the low battery warning has me a little annoyed. I’ll let you know the reason.My wife has high anxiety and we play relaxing sleep beats or sleep frequencies for her to doze off to most nights. So this is a heads up for anyone who wants to use this to bed. When the battery is low, It will constantly let you know with a voice warning that will interrupt your sleep. It a nice feature to have but I got annoyed because for people who use it for sleep like I do you’ll be rudely awaken to shut it off or plug it in. It’s not adjustable in the app. I’ve ask the manufacturer if they’ll include it in the future, and they just stated it’s built in for the user to know the battery is low. My guess is it’s to prolong the battery and keep it from draining all the way for future fails. Not a big deal still a great speaker with lots to love. I have taken it out to the parties, parks and beaches(where my last favorite speaker the 70w w-king x11 would be competing for space, especially against crowds and waves sounds) I am actually going to buy a second one to have stereo pairing. I think the sounds for the price would be great and more portable then a jbl party box 100.(Also try to produce music on the side check out it out on Spotify, Apple Music and here on Amazon Music.

The sound is very good overall including having good bass, and I’m someone who has subwoofers in my home/vehicle/boat. It made a slight rattle with one woofer one time but it was extremely cold, probably 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Outside of that I’ve used it in lots of cold weather during Michigan winters.

Most speakers loose bass because they do not provide enough power. The Tribit has the power needed.This is the first BT speaker in it price range that has blown me away! I like my JBL Extremes but would trade them for this any day.Battery life is not what is advertised for any volume above 20%. For the sound that it puts out at 40%, this is understandable. It maintains the bass up until ~80%, then loses some to prevent distortion. It is LOUD at 3/4 volume level.One thing I like about Tribit speakers is the designed ability for the speaker to be tilted back. This prevents any sound interference from bouncing off the flat surface this may set down on while playing. It makes a difference.The X-bass button is really not needed with this speaker and a decent music source. The bass punches with zero distortion at most sane listening levels. People complain about weight...really? This thing puts 90w of very good sound quality at volume. That means a heavy battery and speaker magnets. I like the lights which can be turned off. It pairs easily with all my devices.These can be paired according to the manual, I do not have a second one to test this. I do NOT use the app, I just use an MP3 player app with good EQ. I do not know if the app is required to pair two of these.

Weight is nowhere near as bad as some reviews make it out to be, u can carry without an issue, and you can always figure out a strap for it, i used one from a wking d7, which this is only slightly heavier than, use your imagination! I would say this one is better indoors and placed in the right place, gotta experiment, outdoors is ok but if out in the wide open you lose that bass reflection, but that would be the same with any speaker. I don't care about lights, wife likes them, whatever! The app is kind of lackluster, I don't even use it, i have an eq in my phone that works through Spotify so no need. Biggest disappointment for me is the battery, they claim 30hrs, we all know not to ever expect that, however, i used 80% after 12hrs at about the 50% volume, with xbass on, half the time was with lights on. There's no situation i can see myself playing this thing at a much lower volume in order to get close to the 30hrs. All in all, i would say it's a decent speaker, probably one of the best in this category of total portability, you can realistically take it anywhere, whereas the next step up is like a pathfinder or something which is much more bulky and much less portable. I'm ok with it at the $150 mark but at the suggested $199 my opinion drops a little bit, however, for the price of one jbl you can have two of these and you're gonna be a much more satisfied listener! Update, picked up a second one, sounds pretty dang good, especially in a decent size room, you can have a pretty good house party with these things, i set them up diagonal from each other in the corners, facing each other, completely fills the room, and the bass reverb is awesome, you can definitely feel it!","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2023",AHJUKLY33QDOC47SQWLMOXMHHVEA,True,3,

The speakers I was using in my garage just really didn't cut it, so I started doing some research and came across this one and decided to give it a try.Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect because I've never heard of this company, but I am so glad I did. The speaker sounded pretty good when I first powered it up and paired it. I thought it would have more bass but was happy with what I heard. But then I saw the ""Xbass"" button on the top and after pressing that -- MAGIC happened and the music flowed with clarity and deep bass like I haven't heard before in a small portable speaker setup.It really has impressed me and sounds amazing, and the LEDs are also fun. I do recommend installing the app and linking it to the speakers, because the 2nd LED option I think is better visually, but that's my opinion of the color patterns.I've been using it for a while now and the battery is still over 95% so I have no idea how long this will last but it's clearly a long time!I'm glad I bought this one and will be getting one for my brother for his birthday.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2024",AEKP7K7G62IHTOPZ6NID5XK6GJ7A,True,4,

R3N3VLP49J4C5,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing For the $$$,Brent James Pourciau,5,"Ok let me first start off by saying I generally put a ridiculous amount of researching multiple brands and different variations of products before purchasing it. Now with that said I can confidently say I made the right choice. I had never heard of Tribit but the reviews outweighed all else so I got it during a lighting deal. Now I already own a Bose sound link and a Bose mini sound link an both of those sound quite good for their size, as expected for a name like Bose…so yesterday after my speaker that sat on the charger 2 nites prior finally got turned on an I was greeted with a pleasant power up cycle of musical key notes instead of the typical bleep, I went into Bluetooth on my iPhone an there it we’d already in there I guess on 1st time pairs at goes into pairing mode so ya super easy…then I connected it to the app I downloaded out the Apple Store which allows you to have a custom EQ or several presets including the X bass feature which is certainly noticeable depending on the song. You can change the synced light show in there see the power status remaining snd so on…I saw a prompt to upgrade to the latest firmware ED. So I did very simple an fast! Now onto the sound I’ll make this easy coming from a musician an audiophile, the Mids are good not great but very exceptional the lows are pretty impressive for a Bluetooth speaker the Highs are well above average for a speaker in this price range and class . I played it for About 2 plus hours steady with the light show an making changes all throughout an at power off it still had 83% remaining, an I was romping it! To sum up I believe I made the right choice…I can’t see where I would find a more powerful great sounding relaxing or partying up Bluetooth speaker anywhere else for this price and be just as happy. If you’ve never really trusted in reviews before let me assure ya I’m extremely scrutinizing of products before purchasing’ don’t worry about researching any further if this is the type of product your looking for fun at the beach or Chilling at home then believe me when I say your search is over! There are many speaker types out there that look similar to this and I’m glad I got this one! Hope This helps your decision making..

Small space so I need hard hitting base and I won't compromise on a full range dynamic sound either. Some of these, even highly rated or well known names, just can't give you what you need in a compact speaker. SUFFER NO MORE my fellow audiophiles this, hits on all levels. I was looking at Bose, Klipsch Nakamichi and so on but it was comments made in a Harman Kardin review that led me here. I've never heard this quality in such a small package. I had to order it twice. Not to have 2 of them but because the first one""Got lost"" about half a mile away on a warm March evening. Long story and not mine to tell lol. Took it out of the box and it Bluetoothed right up.

RJY2NHU4RQMZ7,B09PMYTJD2,"5.0 out of 5 stars Loud, quality sound to fill your next party or outdoor boogie",Forrest Ruby,5,"At first glance this thing looks a little cheesy. The rainbow light show on the front is a major feature of this boombox and I was hesitant to get it, despite the rave reviews about the quality and loudness of the sound it produces, because it doesn't look like something a man in his 30s would own. Having taking it camping, adventuring, and partying all over the last six months I can say honestly the light show is an attraction about this thing. The rainbow lights dance to the music and fill a dark space with some much needed energy, and it can be changed to solid colors that will change occasionally (though you don't control that), or you can turn them off entirely.That out of the way, let's talk sound. This boombox is loud, and it will easily fill a gathering of a couple dozen people in or outdoors. The bass is really powerful as well and it really takes the energy up a notch when people can feel the bass. It can be boosted as well if that is your preference, and I haven't yet found a loudness at which either the speaker drivers or the woofer plates bleed or cackle. This is a solid device that will deliver you very good sounding playback with the added benefit of powerful bass and an entertaining light show.It is deceptively heavy, because of the sizable rechargeable non-removable battery but the carry handle is built right into the frame for ease of movement. For the price of this thing you are putting yourself in the same range as comparable BT speakers from name brands that sell for 50-100% more. Coming across the review for Tribit on PC Mag was a great find, and I'm glad I gave this brand and box a try. My friends are converts as well and two others have already bought smaller models for their own use.

R2ZXEY7IFNEG53,B09PMYTJD2,5.0 out of 5 stars Its heavy and loud,Keon B. Billings,5,"I was skeptical about the battery, life claims, and about the alleged base that this thing puts out. I can now officially say humbly and with respect that this thing delivers even more so than some reviewers claimed. The base is impressively deep and rich given the size of the speakers, and the battery life went for several hours for me without losing volume. I cannot attest to its acclaimed battery life, but it ran several hour for me, and I am more than happy with its performance.Don't go getting any bright ideas this single speaker can power your house party by itself fill the entire room with sound, etc. etc. It is definitely loud, it definitely have a lot of base for its size, and the battery life is impressive. However, please be realistic in your expectations. When you blast any system, no matter who makes it, Bose, JBL, Sony, beats, it doesn't matter. The higher you push the volume, the more battery it uses, and the shorter your playtime will be. That's just a basic fact of electronics and battery life.That said, this unknown company Tribit have a gem on their hands with this speaker box. I highly recommend it.As for the weight of this thing, I can only assume that it's weight is due to the charge circuit and electronics is inside the unit. Most portable units have a single USB connection that charges the device from an external charge adapter or some other unit plugged into the wall. In the case of this device, all those electronics are packaged inside the unit and seeing that it's enclosed, I'm pretty sure they use more beefy components than normal. That plus the accompanying batteries I believe added up to the weight. Knowing this information, I am more than happy because now I don't have to look for a charger adapter to charge my Bluetooth speaker because it's already inside, I just need to plug it in.If you have not already figured it out, I highly recommend the speaker. It's plenty loud, it's got lots of headroom for highs and lows, and they have great battery life.

Probably good for young folks looking to bang around with easily portable sound that can hold up to a lot of use. However, I was seriously disappointed in the mids and highs from this unit. If I had listened to it prior to buying I would not have purchased. Admittedly, I am picky about sound quality. In this case I relied on the reviews about the sound quality and learned my lesson.

RQ0KAAABTX2OS,B09PMYTJD2,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound - Some Limitations,Troy Dvorak,4,"If you want power and great sound in a small package, Tribit knocks it out of the park. I now own two of their products and am very impressed. That is the very most important thing, of course, when you buy stereo equipment. There is an app you can download that has an EQ which is nice.Sadly, the unit is VERY heavy. What in the world is in there? Second, there are only two lighting options on the unit. So I downloaded the app...only the same two options. Both options are bright and way to busy (multiple colors that sync to the beat). Tribit desperately needs to revamp this to keep up with brands like JBL and Sony. Their Bluetooth speakers allow for wonderful, adjustable ambient lighting. The Stormbox lighting is clearly designed for 14 year old kids having a party (or older people who enjoy inducing their own seizures LOL). Fortunately, there is a third option...OFF.Because the app did not offer any more lighting options, and because I use the EQ in my music app, I deleted the app.Overall, for sound quality, I highly recommend this. For those complaining that there is not enough bass, use the EQ feature on your music app or the Tribit app. You will be just fine.For portability, I do not because of the weight. The lights are also very annoying.Finally, for those complaining that there is no radio, try reading the product information before you buy!!","Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023",AH4F6BGQJMB6XW5TJLLUM55BQV7Q,True,4,

I have been very impressed with Tribit after buying a Stormbox last summer for my eScooter. I have wanted to buy a larger portable Bluetooth speaker for a while that was water resistant but JBL is very expensive. I wanted to replace my 4 Flip5s with one big speaker, my batteries are shot on those, but after over 5 years, they did very well. This Tribiy delivers. It sounds great, the bass button is awesome, really fills a room and it gets LOUD. I wish the sound went more directions like JBLs, but what does come out sounds amazing. Played with it a few hours and hasn't moved off 100% battery life. I also like the light show, there are two options or you can turn it off, side lights indicate volume. I know it's not loud in my video but the volume isn't even at 30% and it's much louder in person, I wanted to show off the lights lol. I love the buttons, the center circle is multi function and you can skip back and forth, play/pause with one button, and the volume buttons are dedicated. The app is awesome because it has all that functionality as well as access to preset equalizers and the ability to make your own. Super easy to set up and learn the functions. You can also use it to charge electronics of the usb-C on the back which will be very handy. I bought the carrying case and it basically covers enough to carry it by strap, which is awesome. I wish it had a compartment to put the charging cord in but I doubt you'll need to charge it during a day or night of use.

R3AK5LLZ1VVTWJ,B08X4YMTPM,"5.0 out of 5 stars INSANE Speaker! Quality, volume, battery, and features make this THE BEST!",Jeremy,5,"The JBL Charge 5 is the BEST speaker I have ever owned. I have had the average run-of-the-mill bluetooth speaker that has around a $20 value, for over a year, and I thought it was good sound quality, and I never thought I needed something “fancy.” Well, that speaker started having problems, and I was carefully searching for another speaker. I found this speaker and I thought I would try something new. I only had one thought as I played music out of it for the first time. WOW! The JBL Charge 5 has the best sound quality I had ever heard from a bluetooth speaker. I don’t ever plan on getting another speaker; that is, a speaker that isn’t JBL or an upgraded version of the Charge 5. The clarity is absolutely stunning! The bass is DEEP. I can feel the bass through my whole room! The volume is insane. I rarely have it over 50%, but in the event where I need it louder, I turn it up. I once had music filling a whole event center that was quite a reasonable size. If I could choose one word to describe this speaker, it would be “Stunning,” “Powerful,” or “Supercharged!(Pun intended.)” On that note, the battery life on this thing is long! I once had the speaker provide some background noise for about two days and the battery life was barely lower than 70% (I think…it’s hard to tell exactly with the battery indicator; definitely above 60%). Of course, the battery drains quicker when you have the speaker playing at high volumes. Also, it can take some water. Some being a little, I prefer not to put it to the test. Here is my takeaway:DESIGN: 9/10 Great! I love the fabric covering. The JBL logo is made of metal, which makes it look very nice and official. The buttons are easy to distinguish, and the light is on the power, bluetooth, and there is a ring of light around those two buttons when PartyBoost is in effect. There is a battery bar right below the JBL Logo, and it serves as a general battery indicator. You can get the 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. You can get more info on the battery via the app. The weight is surprisingly light, considering the volume this speaker is capable of. Although, it isn’t the most portable of portable speakers as it is a little big and has a football shape. You can get a case for it that has a strap though. For the skip feature, you have to press the play/pause button twice. Make sure that when you do this, you maintain a consistent interval of time between the two presses. If you do it too fast it will just pause. If you do it too slow, it will just pause then play again.BATTERY: 10/10 Perfect! I absolutely love the battery. I’m the kind of person that prefers the longest possible battery, and doing whatever it takes to preserve it. I don’t have to worry much about this battery. Like I said, it has provided some low music for almost 2 days and the battery wasn’t that affected. However, the battery life will drain much more rapidly when using the speaker at high volumes. I currently use this speaker with a projector to watch TV. I have watched lots of movies and TV shows, and I don’t have to pay much attention to the battery. I just plug it in every other night, and it does great! And having a battery bank is the cherry on top. I haven’t used it much, as I keep most of my devices fully charged, but I think it is awesome that it has a battery bank if I need it.SOUND QUALITY: 10/10(10.5/10) Stunning! I didn’t expect that sound quality could get this good for a bluetooth speaker. JBL means business! When I turn it to high volumes, I can actually feel air blowing from it! On that note, it can go REALLY high in volume. I did not expect that at all. Insane volume. As stated earlier, I use this with a projector, and for all my TV. Watching movies with this speaker makes the entire experience cinematic! A much bigger upgrade compared to the sound TV’s come with. I would even say that it can contend with some soundbars out there (not the JBL Surround Sound System though…that one seems like the top-tier of JBL). This speaker was my first experience with JBL speakers (other than the car speakers) and I was very impressed. It has been the best sound experience I have ever had. Really clear and crisp audio, and when I say “really,” I mean truly! When playing music, I can hear every instrument, every breath, and incredible bass. The bass is a superstar in and of itself. Like I said, the bass shakes my whole room when playing music, and when watching movies! The side radiators really, really pack a punch! There is even an adjustable EQ on the app. Though I prefer what the speaker came with. It is a little pricey, (just a little) but know that you get what you pay for! I don’t think that I can ever go back to what I had…PARTYBOOST: 9/10 Great! I had one, so I bought two more so I could create a surround sound with my TV. It kinda worked. I think I had some sort of connectivity issue, so all I’ll say is that the range might not be that great, so make sure you keep them somewhat close. If you have a projector that has bluetooth and you want to use PartyBoost, I would consider researching what you can do with the Bluetooth latency (As stated earlier, I watch TV with this, and please note there IS some lag between sound and video, as bluetooth will do. However, that is just bluetooth technology, not JBL. Over time my ears and eyes have adjusted, and now it is not that big a deal). In addition to standard bluetooth latency, PartyBoost will make this delay greater (I ended up returning the other two because of this issue). For music, this is not a problem, because it is just sound and no video. With music, PartyBoost is pretty cool! It really creates a much louder and much cooler sound experience. You can even use just two for a stereo effect, and it works great!Overall, this has been the BEST bluetooth speaker experience I have ever had. You better believe I’ll be there for the Charge 6 or 7 or wherever they decide to take this. They really have something good going here. I would 110% recommend this! If you are reading this review, and you would like an upgrade to your typical listening experience, know that this is one of the best out there! And if you catch this at a discounted price, you’ll know you are getting a great deal. JBL has been the best listening experience for me. I will continue buying their products if they keep supplying a high-quality experience. I mean, let the 27,000 ratings with a 4.8 overall rating speak for itself. Here is a simplified pro-con list:PROS-Excellent audio clarity-Excellent bass-Excellent overall sound-Exceptional volume-Long battery life-Battery bank feature-Waterproof feature-Adjustable EQ-Stereo Effect-PartyBoost for multiple speakersCONS-Button timing for the skip track-Could be slightly more portable (We do have the Flip speakers for that though)","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2024",AEDM32EKQE2HOHUCSXFF2Z27F7NQ,True,78,Color: Black
R158T5SJCSV7IQ,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Great Durability,Miguel Gomez,5,"The media could not be loaded. I recently got my hands on the JBL CHARGE 5 Portable Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, and I have to say, it’s been an awesome addition to my music setup. Whether I’m chilling at home, heading to the beach, or just hanging out in the backyard, this speaker has been delivering on all fronts.First off, let’s talk about the sound quality. It’s impressive! The audio is clear and crisp, making everything from podcasts to my favorite tracks sound fantastic. The bass is particularly noteworthy – it’s deep and punchy without being overwhelming. I’ve had other portable speakers before, but this one definitely stands out in terms of delivering that full, rich sound we all crave.The build quality of the JBL CHARGE 5 is also top-notch. It feels solid and durable, which is exactly what you need in a portable speaker. I’m not the gentlest person with my gadgets, so knowing this speaker can withstand a bit of rough handling is a huge plus. The waterproof feature is a game-changer too. I’ve taken it to the pool and the beach, and it’s held up perfectly fine even after getting splashed. No worries about a bit of water ruining the fun.Another awesome feature is the battery life. With up to 20 hours of playtime, this speaker keeps the party going all day and night. And the powerbank USB charge-out is a lifesaver! I can charge my phone on the go, which is super handy during long outings or when I forget to charge my phone beforehand. JBL PartyBoost is another cool feature that lets you pair multiple JBL speakers for an even bigger sound. I haven’t tried it yet, but it sounds like a blast for larger gatherings.Honestly, I’ve struggled to find any real cons with this speaker. It’s a bit on the heavier side, but considering the sound quality and battery life, it’s a trade-off I’m happy to make. The price is a bit higher compared to some other portable speakers, but you’re definitely getting what you pay for in terms of quality and performance.In conclusion, the JBL CHARGE 5 is a fantastic portable speaker that’s worth every penny. With clear, clean sound, excellent bass, and high-quality materials, it’s perfect for anyone looking to amp up their music experience. Whether you’re an audiophile or just someone who loves good tunes on the go, this speaker won’t disappoint. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AEPFUMZ5YUTQEWFAW7FOQKK4BDBA,True,27,Color: Black

R20JW8VDOEC2BP,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Mid-range Bluetooth Speaker,REDBLINKER,5,"This speaker is my 3rd JBL. I first bought the JBL Pulse 5 speaker awhile back, and I really love that one, especially for the light show it can do, but it's a little large to pack up and haul. Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have. Anyway I really love this JBL Charge 5, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth speaker that can get loud, but offers easy portability.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFE42LBIADDXKHZ66MQRD7DE7JYQ,True,2,Color: Camouflage

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4YMTPM,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15’ feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to “stereo” mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5’s anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that’s the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to “forget device” on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,True,22,Color: White

R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4YMTPM,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card.

Well when he came home I borrowed his to take to work, I am a nurse at a small nursing home and my residents love to listen to music they will come out of their rooms and sit at their doorways so they can hear my music from my flip 5 speaker that I sit on top of my med cart in the hallway and all my residents can hear such great quality music from such a little device. I will even dance in the hallway with them even if they are in wheelchairs or can stand. It is amazing what some good peppy music does for even the elderly people, I can see their whole attitudes change and the smiles on their faces are priceless. One resident that recently passed away from COVID, was sitting in her doorway months ago as I had my flip 5 on and music playing and I asked her who was her favorite musician or song and I like to fell out when this elderly Caucasian female said Michael Jackson and song was Billie Jean so I looked it up on my phone and played it for her and she was in a wheelchair but she still patted her foot to the music and tapped her hand and fingers on her table and at times I could hear her singing along and this made me so happy to do this for her we had a great time that Sunday afternoon and a memory I will never forget This awesome little cute speaker charges up quickly just a few hours and good to go and I have used mine for a whole 8 plus shift even if not playing music it would still be on and I have yet to hear any low battery beeps etc. My husband loves that they are waterproof because of him working outside in the dirt and rain. He said what sold him on buying one for him was a friend he worked with had one also and forgot his hanging on the basket on a line truck and the next morning he got it and had dirt and mud on it so he took it over to the water hose and washed it off and all the dirt and mud can completely off and the water didn't do anything to this flip 5 speaker he shook it as dry as he could get it then hung it back on his bucket on his line truck and turned it on and worked just as good as before. I say if u love music and love even sharing music with others this little speaker is highly recommended by me and my husband. It is simple to connect to his and my iPhones. The buttons on the speakers are very easy to press and can be easily seen on the speaker. Also the volume can be adjusted by my iPhone volume buttons too. It makes the cutest sound when connecting to my phone which tells me is is connected. Never had an issue with it disconnecting for no reason. The range is good that is the range that my cell phone is from the speaker never had an issue with that I play music on it and put my cell in my scrub pocket and I am up and down the hallways and in rooms with doors closed and music keeps playing. I can't think of one problem/issue or complaint about this JBL flip 5 speaker. Worth the money and my residents appreciate me spending this small amount of money for them to have some happiness in their day and I do too. My husband bought his from a person advertising a used one wanting to sell when he was up north working I think he bought his for $50 dollars but I always use my Amazon prime so in case I don't like something I buy or have an issue I can return free and free 2 day shipping. And not very much more did I pay here for mine. I got pink and it is a pale pink not bright pink. I like it. I don't know if my managers at the nursing home that I work at would care or not about me playing music over my speaker but even if they did I would probably still sneak and do it because of the reactions I get from my elderly confused residents the smiles on their faces is why I would go against what a manager tells me not to do and do it anyway. These residents don't get much joy to be honest esp since COVID and isolation since middle of March 2020. They are depressed because they can not see (except through a closed window in their rooms) and can not touch their loved ones we that work there and love everyone of our residents don't replace the touch and hugs ans kisses they would be getting from the people they love the most in this world their children and grandchildren and even great grandchildren we have had residents pass away and they and their families haven't seen or touched since COVID and these are precious memories they can never get back it is depressing to me and I play music to keep all our minds off this depressing situation we are in right now and this little speaker helps me do this and is powerful enough to be heard from my med cart all the way down hallways and inside rooms. So even the residents that are bedridden can still hear some good music. So if u like good quality sound that can come from a small well built Bluetooth speaker that won't break your wallet then please buy this one. It also has a rope handle that my husband uses to hang his off the side of his bucket and it be out of his way. He is a lineman and stands in a bucket with limited room up high off the ground sometimes all day long so the rope handle is strong enough to hang this Light weight speaker from a hook and no worries of it breaking. Also I have accidentally dropped my speaker out of my nursing bad onto the cement floor in the nursing home and scared me because I would have been sick if it had broke my awesome speaker but turned it on and worked as usual I dropped it outside in the parking lot and no issues. Hope my review helps you realize this speaker is a good buy and u will be happy u did buy this one. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2021",AH4CCKUJS5JCTKNTUC7KGI7ZBBYA,True,467,Style: Flip 5Color: Pink

When I purchase a car, I could care less if the seats heat up or if it's slick and flashy. Those things are nice, but my goal is to not have to constantly take my vehicle for repairs after I've finished making the payments. So, I don't care that this speaker doesn't light-up or have bells and whistles. What I like about this speaker is that the sound is awesome. I was pleasantly surprised that a speaker this small could pack such a big punch. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the sound and the quality.

I got no where near 12 hours of use out of a charge, but I did get 7 so it's still more than enough for most needs.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AEOUNEXLOXP3FBES2FX4IKMHHOMA,True,2,Style: Flip 5Color: Black

Sound quality is exactly what's to be expected from JBL and frankly, I was pleasantly surprised with it. Hit the bass boost in a large room and away you go! Now I read with interest the poor reviews primarily centered around battery life or lack thereof. I believe the issue(s) with the battery is consumer induced. I charge the unit before using it (the manual suggest not operating it while plugged in) and directly afterwards before storage. After eight weeks of usage, not so much as a hiccup. Now I imagine running the battery low or until the unit shuts down (also not recommended in the owner's manual) and storing in a discharged state is counter intuitive, unless the the operator has an IQ equal to that of a root vegetable. I highly recommend this product... it performs wonderfully and I imagine, as a JBL product, will so for some time to come. Great value for the dollar.
