This project is part of an externship program with Beats by Dre on extern.com. Participants in the program experience the role of a Data Analyst at Beats, analyzing and developing the companyâ€™s audio products.

The project focuses on analyzing reviews of different Bluetooth speaker products, including the Beats Pill, currently sold on Amazon. In this project, I will apply my key skills at EDA, Sentiment analysis and generative AI to achieve the following key objectives:

- Understand the overall Bluetooth speaker market, the level of competition, and the strengths and weaknesses of each product.

- Gain insights into customer reviews specific to the Beats Pill.

- From customer feedback, propose product improvements to enhance customer satisfaction.

- Recommend marketing activities to help the product reach a wider audience.

The dataset consists of customer reviews for 11 different portable Bluetooth speaker products available on Amazon, including the Beats Pill. These speakers come from leading brands known to be major competitors of Beats, such as JBL, Bose, Sony, W-King, and Tribit. All the products have the same price range and key features such as portability, Bluetooth connectivity, battery capacity, and weight. The raw data was collected on September 4th, 2024, using the oxlab.io website.
